=====Ecks=====
*<s>Is it really relevant to this particular droid that Sidious was behind the invasion plan? Seems like mentioning Gunray would suffice. 
*"''As a result, the Federation was able to capture the planet's capital of Theed, leading to its subsequent occupation and capture of its citizens.''" Two instances of the "capture" here, maybe reword one of them. 
*"''After entering the hangar, Jinn steadily approached[4] 1933 and the other droids,[2] causing a brief moment of uncertainty between the droids as the Jedi assumed their positions,[4] where Jinn was shortly ordered to halt by 2163.''" The last clause here doesn't really connect well to the rest of the sentence; ''where'' exactly is Jinn ordered to halt? Maybe the clause could be moved to the next sentence where you talk about Jinn being halted, as well.
*"''However, before the droids could follow their orders and raise their blasters, Jinn activated his lightsaber and destroyed 2163, resulting in 1933's death in the Jedi's swing.''" If I'm understanding this correctly, 1933 and 2163 were killed in the same swing, right? If so, you could simply say "destroyed 2163 and 1933 in his swing", thus removing that last, somewhat choppy clause.</s> [[User:Xd1358|<span style="color:#336600;font-weight:bold;">1358</span>]] [[User_talk:Xd1358|<sup style="color:#336600;">(Talk)</sup>]] 17:42, 20 May 2022 (UTC)

*<s>Does Neff's scene in [[Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back 1|''Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back'' 1]] play out the same as the film?

**It does, and literally I'm not quite seeing how it needs to be documented when it doesn't alter the events at hand. We wouldn't document LEGO games when the only nature of the subject appearing doesn't contradict or offer new information. [[User:Hanzo Hasashi|Hanzo Hasashi]] ([[User talk:Hanzo Hasashi|talk]]) 14:26, 28 May 2022 (UTC)
***FWIW, the scene in question has different dialogue between the other characters in the scene, acknowledging the different events being played out, but Neff remains without any lines, and as such, nothing different with him individually. Comparatively adaptations in similar situations, with characters saying different things in the scenes, or even different events around the characters, aren't documented. For [[Wuher/Legends|Wuher]], as an example, the LEGO games wouldn't be noted in behind the scenes for how, while he's in the cantina, unlike in the movie, Obi-Wan kills Ponda Baba, and doesn't attack Evazan, who just runs away, differing from how he injures both in the film.

*I don't usually make these types of objections, but this article is in desperate need of a copy-edit. There are numerous small issues that could and should have been caught prior to nomination, including but not limited to punctuation errors, improper capitalization, references before punctuation, missing grammatical articles, and tense issues.

=====Erebus=====
*AT-ST and AT-AT shouldn't be abbreviated for a first mention/link.
*The fact that the Battles of Hoth and Endor took place in 3 ABY and 4 ABY can't be sourced to those cards.
*Intro could be expanded a little bit.
*Not sure if the fact that the Battle of Hoth was an obvious tactical victory but a strategic failure for the Empire can be sourced straight to the film.
*A quote from Episode VI could probably be added. [[User:Erebus Chronus|<b><span style="color:#3e236e">Erebus Chronus</span></b>]] <sup>[[User talk:Erebus Chronus|<b><span style="color:#3e236e">(Talk)</span></b>]]</sup> 22:02, 22 February 2022 (UTC)

*Skin color in the infobox should be linked.
*"Ultimately, the battle would end in a tactical victory, though strategic failure for the Imperials." please elaborate on how it's a tactical but not strategic victory.
*"After the ambush of the Endor shield generator bunker, which was protecting the under construction Imperial battlestation, the Death Star II," [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] should be pipelinked through "ambush" instead of linked in the next sentence.
*Also, I don't beleive I've ever seen Death Star or Death Star II italicised. '''[[User:Fan26|<span style="color:#003">Fan26</span>]]''' (<span style="color:#003">'''[[User talk:Fan26|Talk]]'''</span>) 13:47, 3 March 2022 (UTC)

*'''Nomination comments''': Originally introduced as a terrestrial astro object in [[Battlefront: Twilight Company|BTC]], Bamayar was then mentioned again in the [[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)|Rogue One novel]], which also conveniently gave a separate mention of [[Bamayar IX]], a gas giant which is thus&hellip;non-terrestrial. It makes me wonder if Bodhi Rook spent the majority of his OG Imperial career working around a Bamayar system with them both in. The encyclopedia does a lovely job of differentiating between the two and actually calling Bamayar a planet, which is always a lovely detail to catch up on. And thus I am here nominating them both.

*<s>I don't see any need for subsectioning.</s>
**The subsection means there's room for two images in the bio, otherwise the first one overlaps with the infobox. Although I'd usually leave three paragraphs unsubsectioned I don't think it's excessive to do so and I'd say overall it benefits the reader more to leave it and keep the image.

**Image sizes should always be specified. The standard thumbnail size is 300px.
**Rather than mention the concept of core names in the prose, simply saying ''Clarr'ivl'exow "Rivlex"'' is fine.

**"''A sector was located in the northeast-zenith of the Chiss Ascendancy. It contained the Ornfra system and the planet Ornfra.''" &mdash;this is repeated word-for-word between the intro and the body.

*<s>Welcome to the GAN! Good work overall; here are my preliminary objections:</s>
**Ambiguous terms such as "managed to" are typically reserved for when there's a special need for them, so it's best to remove it here.
***Removed [[User:Panther436|Panther436]] ([[User talk:Panther436|talk]]) 21:44, 13 April 2022 (UTC)
**Files and templates need to use underscores in place of spaces (e.g. <nowiki>[[File:Luke_Skywalker.jpg]], not [[File:Luke Skywalker.jpg]]</nowiki>).
***Fixed [[User:Panther436|Panther436]] ([[User talk:Panther436|talk]]) 21:44, 13 April 2022 (UTC)
**Since [[attack on the Zygerrian slave camp]] is a conjecturally titled article, "attack" should not be capitalised in the date reference.
***Fixed [[User:Panther436|Panther436]] ([[User talk:Panther436|talk]]) 21:44, 13 April 2022 (UTC)
**The date reference should be fully cited as well. Some of the info in it is from ''Tempest Runner'', but that book isn't mentioned in it. Also, you have established that the attack must take place before ''Light of the Jedi'', but that doesn't necessarily mean it took place before the year in which LOTJ took place. Would "by 232 BBY" be a more accurate timeframe for the attack?
***Sourced and adjusted for accuracy [[User:Panther436|Panther436]] ([[User talk:Panther436|talk]]) 21:44, 13 April 2022 (UTC)
**When pipelinking, always place all characters inside the link brackets (e.g. <nowiki>[[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]], not [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]]s</nowiki>).
***Should italicized links be written as <nowiki>''[[The High Republic: Tempest Runner]]'' or [[The High Republic: Tempest Runner|''The High Republic: Tempest Runner'']]</nowiki> ? [[User:Panther436|Panther436]] ([[User talk:Panther436|talk]]) 21:22, 13 April 2022 (UTC)

=====Ecks Dee=====
*<s>I'm finding the Biography to be excessively play-by-play in some parts. In general, one should be very careful about prose-ifying dialogue. "''After Kroleyic was incapacitated by Rancisis using the Force, Azim ran to check on Dee, asking if she could stand. After she said she could, Azim introduced himself and his master, telling her that they were there to help.''" This could be written far more concisely: "''After Kroleyic was incapacitated by Rancisis using the Force, Azim ran to check on Dee, introducing himself and his master and telling her that they were there to help.''" No need to recount individual lines of a conversation. Please go through the entire Biography and see if there are instances where you can shorten down parts like this a bit.</s> [[User:Xd1358|<span style="color:#336600;font-weight:bold;">1358</span>]] [[User_talk:Xd1358|<sup style="color:#336600;">(Talk)</sup>]] 17:22, 4 May 2022 (UTC)
**I smoothed some things out. However, I think that the focus on dialogue is a side-effect of this article being based off material from an audio drama and only really having dialogue to go off of for events. [[User:Panther436|Panther436]] ([[User talk:Panther436|talk]]) 02:23, 5 May 2022 (UTC)

=====Hi, I'm Immi Thrax=====
*<s>Right now, the article closes very abruptly without transition; the last paragraph jumps from a comment on his original casting to saying he reprised in the sequel and then he died. Some possible questions to help this be less abrupt: What has been said about his role in KOTOR 2? Did any of his SW collaborators or the SW social media have anything to say about his legacy upon his passing?

**I don't think there's a way to get around it, I've scoured the net for everything you've suggested [[User:Commander Code-8|<b><span style="color: Purple">Commander Code-8</span></b>]] <sup>[[User talk:Commander Code-8|<span style="color: Maroon">Hello There!</span>]]</sup> 07:40, 20 July 2022 (UTC)
***It looks like he had an Insider interview published around the time of the game releases (''"In an interview about the Star Wars radio series published in 2004"'') or between them? The mention of that interview is only during the radio section. It makes sense to keep the material about the radio production where it is, but it could help with the abruptness of "KOTOR, KOTOR2, death" to put a mention of that interview where it fits chronologically.

****I've added a mention of the interview but I'm not sure that it totally solves your issue, given that it precedes KOTOR 2
*<s>I think it's worth (briefly) touching on how he and [[Mark Hamill]] both contributed voices to many of the same projects, even though they didn't overlap on Star Wars specifically. To help with identifying those, here are [https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?roles=nm0000799,nm0000434 IMDB search results] where they are both listed. Mark was photographed with Ed at the latter's 90th birthday and celebrity roast, so he may well have had something to say about Ed that's worth noting.

**There's a pop culture obsessed part of me that wants to document this, but it might need some wider reflection/discussion on the function of our OOU articles in relation to where we draw the line about cast and crew members association with fellow SW actors. Are notable collaborations/friendships totally in line with our purview as a ''Star Wars'' wiki?

**Context: Added.
**So, at the very end of the book there's one last page that says "And a new journey was about to begin for R2-D2 and C-3PO," featuring a poster-style illustration with Leia, Luke, Han, Chewbacca, Vader, the Death Star, and some starfighters. Nobody on the page is mentioned by name and none of them is featured anywhere else in the story, which is why I think a previous editor included the "final-page illustration only" note. If you would like me to remove it, I can. I don't feel strongly about it one way or another.

*The extra information about Rebel Files being buried and excavated isn't really relevant here since there are no additional notes from the Resistance (e.g. [[Zorbia]]).

=====Braha=====
*"''in Cloud City on the gas giant''" given Cloud City is floating, I don't think ''on'' is the best terminology here.
**Fixed.
*"''where Galactic Republic fighters had tried and failed to defend themselves from the Empire''" If the Empire exists by that point, I think it should be reworded to note that the Republic technically doesn't exist anymore.
**Fixed.
*"''It was then that the doors to the dining room opened, and Gersolik tried to reach for the access panel to the room, only to be stopped by Sbazzle.''" Is this meant to be the bit where Han, Leia and co. run into Vader? There should be some context for this.
*I think that the intro is too short of detail {{C|[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836662088998977638/883815620741836831/Picture1.png and a bit short for the word count]}}. Stuff like Lando bringing the two chefs into a meeting, the theorizing of poisoning methods, and the stuff that happens in the final bio paragraph (besides her being furious) should be mentioned in there in my opinion.

**Okay, I see what you're saying in terms of word count, but I disagree that the level of detail needs to be finer (at the end of the day I'm going over the WC anyway so it doesn't really matter though).

*Curious about that canceled novel mentioned in the ''Kenobi'' cover blog. There's nothing out there to cross-reference with? Maybe we'll learn more about this in the future.

**If I had to guess, it's ''[[The Mandalorian: An Original Novel]]''. Manchess has a lot of unofficial art of the series and even used characters from the show in his art classes. I was tempted to ask him directly, but he probably wouldn't have been able to even tell us, and he was already gracious enough to answer some other questions.

The discrepancy in the article has unfolded a bit more and I don't have the time to totally try to resolve it right now, and I'd like to get some other input first anyway. 
*"''he conspired with Iaco Stark and Hask of the Trade Federation to engineer a profitable bacta shortage''&hellip;" - Adol Bel's encyclopedia entry that I only just thought to check
*"''He formed an alliance with Adol Bel of the Xucphra Corporation, and developed a plan to starve the Old Republic of bacta and reap huge profits. The plans were thwarted by Iaco Stark, whose Commercial Combine began raiding the few bacta convoys leaving Thyferra, then reselling the bacta at cheaper prices.''" - Hask's encyclopedia entry
*"''The bacta thefts were a ruse cooked up between Stark and the Trade Federation's viceroy''" - The Essential Atlas p. 140, admittedly a little different to what I had recorded in the BTS at this time so my bad.
My thinking is that the best way to resolve this is to assume that Stark was involved in the bacta shortage on Thyferra but that he went rogue after that. I don't think there's anyway to rationalize the Atlas's statements given that the comic depicts an attack on a bacta transport clearly. Additionally the article has said that Hask was the viceroy prior to The Essential Guide to Warfare's publication, so I might acknowledge that in the BTS [[User:Commander Code-8|<b><span style="color: Purple">Commander Code-8</span></b>]] <sup>[[User talk:Commander Code-8|<span style="color: Maroon">Hello There!</span>]]</sup> 13:32, 4 April 2022 (UTC)

**Well now, that's interesting. I suppose it couldn't hurt for it to have a page. This is the exact context in which it appears: "For a palate cleanser, Ithorian starfruit blended in a light creme liqueur." Also, looks like the dash above 'creme' is omitted. I'll need to adjust that on the article. I wonder how I missed that. Now, I believe it says 'Ithorian starfruit' because the starfruit is grown on Ithor and the other dishes put the planet of origin before the dish itself in the report.

=====Manoof=====
*<s>I hate to do this but I think this needs to be split between two articles based on the gem campaign: [[Starfruit]] and [[Ithorian starfruit]], a type of starfruit. Reason being is that the gem campaign is worded such that the recipe there is a specific variety of starfruit, being Ithorian. The other mentions from what I can see don't specify this because it's insinuated by surrounding context to be Ithorian variety&mdash;Tiny death star has it in the Ithorian section, Obi-wan notes it specifically as Ithorian and Jettster mentions it in the context of Ithorian originated recipe. This could also explain the discrepancy in Betrayal if it isn't specified to be an Ithorian starfruit? Happy for others to weigh in especially ACs...

**"As a result, between 2 and O BBY, Salline was occupied by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Galactic Empire immediately responded..." This reads slightly oddly, as it's saying the Empire immeadiately responded, while just prior saying that it's been occupied for a span of two years, which would make it not so. Perhaps suitable to add some form of 'at some point between' to refer to those years?
***The city wasn't occupied for two years, the occupation occured during that time. Hopefully clarified.
**In doing some cursory research, I noticed that there's [[The Promotion of Lieutenant Veers]] and [[Star Wars: Empire at War]] (which noted on Veers' page as documenting his promotion to Colonel). With those details, it seems like the date for the Salline pacification could be potentially narrowed to at some point between 1 BBY and 0 BBY; as it had to be while he was colonel.
**To that end as well; unless a contradicting source says Veers was a general at the time, the Imperial Handbook has the report as while he's a colonel, which should be reflected in the article's prose.
***Added.

**There technically is one. However, I didn't link it as around that time Chandrila was ruled by [[Gerald Weizel]]. Since there's no reason to believe that it was him or someone else, it would be misleading to link it.
*<s>Given Mothma's homeworld is Chandrila and she was to some degree part of it's politics, it might have enough relevance to include the fact that she later obtained a copy of the handbook and wrote said note, so that it also wouldn't have to be linked in the quote caption.</s>

**Yes.
*<s>Can Salline being ruled by a governor be sourced to ''Strongholds of Resistance'' or was that reference intended to only specify what Chandrilan House was?</s>
**Apologies, was unclear; Salline itself does not appear to be in SoR itself, given the article only lists the handbook as a source. If SoR says all Chandrilan cities were ruled by a governor part of the Chandrilan House, then a separate ref note should state that since the handbook reveals Salline is a Chandrilan city, it must be ruled by a governor of that body due to the information about such cities in SoR&mdash;rather than just citing it to SoR without context.'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 23:48, 8 April 2022 (UTC)

*<s>Preliminaries</s>
**There's a bit of a disconnect in the date ref. You've established the main timeframe of the novel, and that's all fine and dandy, but then it kind of just jumps to saying M2-M5 must have been destroyed at that time as well.
***Does that clarify?
**I've seen it a few times now, so you must just have missed it, but "Twilight Company" falls under the proper compound noun clause in [[WP:MOS#Linking]].
***I'm confused, none of the linking section mention proper nouns. What am I breaking here?
****Specifically, I'm referring to this section "''<nowiki>But do not link individual words within proper compound nouns (examples: [[Death]] [[Star]], [[Color|Azure]] [[Dianoga]] [[Cantina]], [[The galaxy|Galactic]] Empire, ''[[Bantha]]''-class assault shuttle)''</nowiki>" [[User:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111">'''OOM'''</span>]] [[User talk:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111;font-family:franklin gothic">224</span>]] 21:34, 26 March 2022 (UTC)

**"''explaining the matter to First Sergeant Hazram Namir when the pair talked about the issue''" &mdash; the "talked about the issue" seems to be redundant to "explaining the matter." Can we do without it?
***Removed.
**Those two images have been used on like a dozen status articles by now, but I'm not complaining :P However, that first image's caption is a complete sentence as well.
***Blame the lack of BTC related images :(. I'm never gonna get the hang of image caption punctuation.
**"''Namir told him to send a full report to Captain Micha Evon about the problem''" &mdash; a bit of a disconnect here too, since there is no apparent link between this and the previous lines. To better convey the flow of events, I would use a word like "thus" here.
***How does that look?
**There's a few missing links, so it'd be great if you could spot them while addressing the other issues. [[User:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111">'''OOM'''</span>]] [[User talk:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111;font-family:franklin gothic">224</span>]] 21:55, 25 March 2022 (UTC)

=====OOM=====
*<s>Preliminaries</s>
**The intro is a little too long for an article of this size. It's got too much detail as well. One paragraph would do fine here.
***Cut down.
**"''bragging about shocking the bounty hunter''" &mdash; do you mean surprising IG-88, or literally shocking him? If it's the latter then you'll probably want to mention the energy binders beforehand for context.
***He planned to do it. Specified that 
**What do you mean by "a piece of metal" and "discovered the metal"? Please specify. I also do not grasp the significance of it. What does it have to do with the binders? Please clarify in the article body.
***Its weird because he discovers the piece of metal on the ground in front of the binders and leaves, and when Moggee returns the binders shock him unconscious. I assume the comic is implying the metal caused the shock. 
**Any reason why CR-8R told this story that perhaps would be relevant to the actions of Moggee?
***CR-8R tells the story to Graf to teach him to have patience.
**Check spelling and grammar in the Personality and traits section.
***Fixed
**Is Moggee's skin pink as well as blueish or just "pink-and-blue." Discreptancy between the infobox and the prose. [[User:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111">'''OOM'''</span>]] [[User talk:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111;font-family:franklin gothic">224</span>]] 06:05, 15 August 2022 (UTC)

**Regarding your second and third objection, do we have a canon source for that? I know there is some legends stuff but i don't know of any canon sources.
***Ok, for these two, I feel like there should be some context for Morley working with Maul. In the episode, he states he found Maul and it's established that he brought Maul victims as food and got the leftovers. I think that should at least be the context.

***Looking back at this one, I not as fussed about it, but I would still like to see something about Maul being a fallen Sith apprentice or something.

*(Part two: The biography) I think the bio in general is lacking in details after watching the episode myself. I think you should include the parts when:
**Morley greets Savage only to be stamped on and choked, followed by their conversation.
***Morley introducing himself and the "payment" part are worth mentioning as well.
**<s>Morley's offer is rejected, but he follows Savage and warns him.</s>
**He brings up the fire-breathers, and Savage is forced to follow him to safety.
***"''and Opress had to follow the Anacondan to get to safety''" that's roughly how it goes, but Morley also ''advised'' him to follow.
**Morley warning Savage about the junkers before the fight actually occurs.
***I think there should be a bit more detail than just "Morley was not keen".
**<s>Morley didn't just 'then' claim he knew of someone looking like Savage. That conversation should be detailed better too.
**Morley advising Savage to take shelter before the latter spots one.</s>
**Morley pretending to be surprised by the state of that shelter with the bodies.
***You should also mention Morley's trap at that point rather than when he actually betrays Savage to set up the context for this trap.
**Savage believing he had been betrayed, leading to him step into Morley's trap.
***This part should be detailed a bit more.
**Savage's final questioning of Morley before he kills him.

=====Spooky=====
*<s>I see that the sw.com article has a different capitalization for the stew, might that be BtS notable?</s>
*<s>Was there any other mention of charhounds consuming the stew other than: "The hound was no fool—of all the Jedi of Elphrona, Bell Zettifar was by far the most likely to slip her a bite or two during meals." in ''Light of the Jedi''? If my skim didn't pick it up then that'd be my bad, but I couldn't seem to find anything else in the stew's scenes, and this specifies the hound was fed but not what it was fed, or if it was stew.</s>
*<s>The stew had a thick consistency, could be served with a ladle, and prepared in a kitchen - which can be added to the body, and the thick mention to the infobox as well as a physical descriptor.</s>
*<s>Is Indeera actually shown consuming the stew? After reviewing the one quote about her and Bell going to meet for breakfast meal, it's not clear whether they'd just known Bell liked it and let him know about it being made for the meal. Unless there's another mention elsewhere, seems like an assumption to say it's consumable by their species when not shown.</s>
*<s>The intro indicates that the stew was ''regularly'' served for meals such as breakfast. Similarly to above, while it can be said it was made for said meal once, what indication of it being a recurring part of breakfast would there be? If there is the context somewhere though, it would be intro exclusive at present.</s>
*<s>Might be nitpicky, but does "favorite" pinpoint Bell's thoughts on the stew? From the mentions I see there's really only one scene where he is seen to actually consume it, but the article implies that it quickly became a favorite part of meal (implying recurring servings) when the relating quote seems to point at him being a fan of the chef's cooking overall. He's certainly shown to enjoy it, but the article also states he "usually" ate two bowls of it when served. I'm not sure that's the best to use either unless missing a mention, as he could've just been hungry that particular day, and not enough to establish it as a usual.</s>
*<s>Greatstorm's scenes in ''The Rising Storm'' reflect that he had smelled the stew before, but not that he had ever consumed it (in relation to the article's mentions of his species finding it consumable).</s>'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 03:03, 13 March 2022 (UTC)
**It's implied that Bell has slipped Ember stew before; she reacts to him asking for more of it.
**Added a note about the consistency. The ladle and kitchen stuff is far too generic to be worth mentioning.
**Removed the stuff about it being edible to Tholothians, as you are correct that the scene does not mention if she had any.
**Removed "regularly".
**Being a favourite of Bell's is implied; the scene makes it clear he really likes it. Cleaned up the other stuff.
**Loden is stated to have an empty bowl in ''Light of the Jedi'', indicating that he ate the stew. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 03:13, 13 March 2022 (UTC)
**Added the capitalization detail; nearly forgot about it. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 03:19, 13 March 2022 (UTC)
***Was there any other mention of the hound regarding stew? If the mentioned quote is the only one, while it could considered as an assumption, the quote only implies that the hound was accustomed to recieving a form of food scraps/bites from Bell during meals. I don't think it's implied that Ember has specifically had this stew before/is able to consume it, given the surrounding context notes that a few of the Jedi took turns caring for the hound in varying ways, including feeding, since they had met.'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 05:24, 13 March 2022 (UTC)

=====Spooky=====
*<s>Is it worth noting the climate as cold in the infobox?</s>
*<s>"..in order to open a vacancy for an Imperial Military figure to be promoted to from the Kuat Drive Yards." I see the the wording "to be promoted to" in the intro, but upon reading it became confusing as to what they'd be promoted ''to''. I'm assuming it means to have someone transferred there, but perhaps the sentence could be slightly tweaked; to have that third 'to' removed or something otherwise, not sure.</s>
**Both addressed.
*<s>From a novel spot-search of Rimma I came up with: "Governor Chalis and her infantry company were striking soft targets along the Rimma Trade Route..."; if they're doing the campaign along the route, would it be fair to say that it could be added to |routes=, and have the 'along' reflected in the body? Seems like with their sights set on eventually Sullust they're going down the route and attacking places, rather than just being near it.</s>
**Now this is something I've gone back and forth from, and I'll explain why. When I went to look at the placing of targets that were more established in Canon, I found that while Sullust was on the Rimma, Xagobah was along a small route just off of it. Meaning "along the Rimma" isn't entirely accurate. It also comes to say that Chalis said "indirect route" in her proposal of Operation Ringbreaker. Thus I have made the decision to take "along the Rimma" with a grain of salt as I have done with all the Ringbreaker targets without proper mapping. If Xagobah is only near the route then other targets could be the same.

*Placing this as a comment because the article is in line with precedent in regards to this, but I'd like to request a change in that. ''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]'' does not explicitly state all [[R2-series astromech droid|R2-series droids]] are .96m (3ft 2in). It only states [[R2-M5]] as that while also stating [[R2-D2]] is 1.09m (3ft 6in), with other sources confirming R2-D2's height. Furthermore, the logic of the X in RX determining the RX-series would suggest [[R2-BHD]] is another R2 that is 1.09m, per the Databank. I think we should either stop applying that droid height to all droids of similair series, or change the reference note to better reflect how we are coming to that conclusion. Additionally, while I think assuming RX-series is a fair assumption, I also think the reference notes should state it is an assumption. I don't see where SWBTMF explicitly states R2-H7 to be one, and I think the reference notes in these situations should reflect that. {{Unsigned|NBDani}}
**Just realized that I should probably actually note here that I'm not ignoring this comment and have spoken to Dani about it. I'm currently trying to figure out a way to test my theory that .96m is R2's height on three legs and 1.09m is the height on two after which I'll implement the new heights referencing across all relevant astromech status articles.

(I took the "It is clear the nominator has not made an effort to read the instructions, so reviewers should not be expected to spend their time reviewing this" allegation, an assucation which I can confirm still was not true, to heart and ensured to edit to flawlessness countless times!)

*'''Nomination comments''': My second live-action (and ''The Mandalorian'') nomination! Comes without saying I've definitely had a lot more insight working on this one that I did with my [[Wookieepedia:Good article nominations/Davan|first]] live-action nom. Riot Mar is ironically also a character I've taken a liking to because of their helmet. And also shoutout to Ayrehead, who did much of the initial work prior to the release all the extra Mando S1 material.

*Review note: some important things to keep in mind for future nominations:
**When pipelinking, always place all characters inside the link brackets (e.g. <nowiki>[[Electrum (Venator-class)|''Electrum'']], not ''[[Electrum (Venator-class)|Electrum]]''; [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]], not [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]]s</nowiki>).
**HTML should be used instead of select punctuation (e.g. <nowiki>"&mdash;" instead of "—," "&ndash;" instead of "–," "&hellip;" instead of "..."</nowiki>).
**For file links, use the format "300px" rather than "200x200px"
*<s>Similarly, files and templates need to use underscores in place of spaces (e.g. <nowiki>[[File:Luke_Skywalker.jpg]], not [[File:Luke Skywalker.jpg]]</nowiki>).</s> [[User:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111">'''OOM'''</span>]] [[User talk:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111;font-family:franklin gothic">224</span>]] 12:56, 17 May 2022 (UTC)

*There is no mention of its founding month on any of Rovio's social medias or websites. (Nor in their affiliate's social medias or websites). I sourced it to a page on Rovio of the Finnish Government.

*As an aside, seeing that in addition to the two games, there are several ''Angry Birds Star Wars'' tie-in books, it might be worthwhile to make a page title "Angry Birds Star Wars (series)" that covers the franchise overall (the two games, the books, and any other spinoff material). Once that page is created it would likely need to be factored into the body of Rovio Entertainment. [[User:Dentface|Dentface]] ([[User talk:Dentface|talk]]) 10:12, 14 February 2022 (UTC)

**Its name was first used in something directly related to both ''Return of the Jedi'' and the Battle of Endor. That's kind of a gray area, and I chose to not make it a retcon in this case.

****You can see it being used in a later source.

*****Sorry for the delay.

=====Spooky=====
*<s>Always a pleasure to see ''Aftermath'' noms. I've fixed a few, but I think it might be worth giving the article another once-over for both missing and duplicate links.</s>
*<s>Given it's got limited mentions, I think some places the Sea is referenced could be added. For instance, when flying over the sea, Temmin notices that [[sensor array]]s can be avoided by flying close to the water.</s>
**Both done.
*<s>In Description, it might suit better to mention how Velus' made a habit of frequenting the tavern in History, and perhaps Leia's office/apartment mentions as well. There seems to be precedent among the terrestrial location GAs to describe the structures and not the people occupying them (at the point in time they're mentioned).</s>
**Moved the tavern info to History. However, I don't really see a way to move the mention of Leia without leaving the office contextless.
***A possible workaround might be something like, "Several buildings overlooked the Silver Sea during the New Republic Era, including an office, an apartment, and a tavern." On perusal, the precedent does seem to omit any character mentions in the section, given they aren't a physical trait of any said location.'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 05:43, 6 March 2022 (UTC)
****I don't think that change is necessary. In my opinion there's no need to mention both locations twice; it makes the article less readable. Also, just saying that there is an apartment or office overlooking the sea doesn't make it clear that the apartment is connected to Leia. [[User:VergenceScatter|VergenceScatter]] ([[User talk:VergenceScatter|talk]]) 08:31, 6 March 2022 (UTC)
*<s>It might suit nicely to add that some context for the dating of the Battle of Jakku. Given it swaps sources from the rest of that paragraph, it's not immeadiately apparent that it's referring to near 5 ABY.</s>
*<s>Some slight expansion on the tavern scene might suit, there's a few details about the sea there, and Velus wasn't there alone.</s>
*<s>Context as [[season]]s for winter and spring.</s>'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 23:47, 5 March 2022 (UTC)
**These three should all be done. [[User:VergenceScatter|VergenceScatter]] ([[User talk:VergenceScatter|talk]]) 00:02, 6 March 2022 (UTC)
*<s>For Description, it's mentioned in ''Life Debt'' that the Silver Sea had a coast, which can then be paired with the details in ''Empire's End'' that said coast bordered the sea with a cliff, as the waves were crashing there.</s>
**Added
*<s>Given the length of the article expanding the intro slightly would suit nicely, perhaps briefly specifying which buildings have the view of said sea, a sentence about Rath Velus' affinity for the tavern, or maybe it's colors.</s>
**Added.
*<s>In the first paragraph of History, it seems a little repetitive to use the phrase "overlooking the Silver Sea" in back to back sentences, given that 'overlook' is also the same word from the book. Mind fiddling with one of the two?</s>
**Changed
*<s>"A tavern that overlooked the Silver Sea was frequented by Imperial defector Sinjir Rath Velus." - Didn't know how best to tweak, but a bit of time-context to this would be nice. It can be determined he did frequent the tavern prior to the visit with the crew, so perhaps an "At some point, Imperial defector Sinjir Rath Velus began frequenting a tavern overlooking the Silver Sea..." or whatnot, so that it's not spontaneously mentioned he's a regular.</s>
**How's that?
*<s>"Temmin flew close to the sea's surface to avoid sensor arrays, causing him to repeatedly crash his starfighter." a cursory observation - is every simulation confirmed to be over the Silver Sea? The way it's worded seems as if he repeatedly crashed due to said sensor array mistake, when, he did crash only once to that. Perhaps reword, to either remove repeatedly, or note that said scenario was one of a group of others that had failed.</s>
**Fixed.
*<s>If Chandrila is said to have a moon, wouldn't that warrant a page? Given it's also near to said mention, it can be specified thai 'his friends' were [[Norra Wexley's team]].</s>
**Don't think it's notable, but created the page. [[User:VergenceScatter|VergenceScatter]] ([[User talk:VergenceScatter|talk]]) 08:31, 6 March 2022 (UTC)

**You put this on here twice :P
*<s>The mentions regarding Leia's office & apartment are omitted from the History.</s>
**I avoided this intentionally. I believe it's repetitive to describe them in two spots and doesn't make sense to split up the information. 
*<s>It would make sense if the intro and the History were consistent with the either full mention of [[flight simulator]] or the pipelinking of it as [[Flight simulator|simulator]] - as both are different atm.</s>'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 05:43, 6 March 2022 (UTC)

***I'd like you to be more precise with the dating in this article. If all we know is that the game would have been set during the reign of the Empire and would have featured the Rebel Alliance, then it would have been set between 19 BBY and 4 ABY, which is what I'd like you to add to the infobox and the body. Saying that it would have been set after 19 BBY, based on just the existence of the Empire alone, is not accurate enough, since it conceivably could have been set ''in'' 19 BBY.

*<s>Is the Development image concept art for ''Imperial Commando''? If it is, it contains a whole lot of info that should be covered in Appearances and Plot summary.</s> [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 08:51, 28 July 2022 (UTC)
**Indeed it is. One of the few available. I didn't include it based on a Discord discussion about concept art not necessarily translating into the game.

***In that case, I don't understand why you're treating some of the concept art (commandos in Katarn armor, lightsabers and Rebel starfighters) as applicable, but not this specific piece. [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 13:33, 28 July 2022 (UTC)
****Sorry, a little clarity.

*****So there's some sort of textual basis in ''Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts'' that supports it being more certain that lightsabers and Rebel starfighters would have appeared in the game than Wookiees, Twi'leks (the rightmost figure in the image looks like a Twi'lek to me, at least), and Humans? And either way, I'm now more convince that all of the details from this or any other concept art image pertinent to ''Imperial Commando'' should be described in the article's text. Whether it should all be in Appearances is a different matter, but again, it depends on what exactly the sources have to say about those story details.

**Given that "TL-50 Repeater" is just a shortened form of "TL-50 Heavy Repeater," I'd just remove it from the intro.

*<s>We should probably be referring to it as "Trask Chowder" due to the cookbook, no?

**I'm really torn on this. I get that the cookbook uses Trask in the title to make it seem Star Wars-y, but it's clearly the exact same chowder as we see in the episode, so to have a page for Trask Chowder and regular chowder seems a little redundant - they'd cover the exact same thing and would be pretty similar. Naturally chowder doesn't only refer to this dish, but I'm not sure the best way to do this.

***Seems like the novel's chapter one details that Thrawn was knocking out perimeter troopers with the concussion grenades and causing other terror to the officers with the power packs, and as a result this trooper (and his squad) were sent to go subdue the Chiss when Barris' men failed. Though on rereading the chapter, it also seems like this specific trooper is said to be holding a blaster rifle as part of the ones sent out (which does match the comic's depiction) and could thus be in equipment.'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 19:44, 20 April 2022 (UTC)

***My main query was to question&mdash;what defines the depicted armor as ''not'' just stormtrooper armor and ''definitely'' clone trooper armor? From what I can see it visually looks exactly like stormtrooper armor (which given, is based on Phase II); and the novel text also calls the individuals searching only by stormtroopers, referring to the CW era stuff as mostly bygone relic. In canon, most of the clones had been phased out by this year given it's so late into the Imperial Era - I'm not doubting that there may be some cases of Imperial stormtroopers assumed to be clones especially in the initial period before the armor types were transferred and the clones were shifted out, but I'd like to hear more about the proof behind this trooper being a clone, specifically.'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 20:37, 8 April 2022 (UTC)

*****In that case&mdash;only referencing to ''Thrawn'' 1 for that wouldn't be enough since; neither of the article's sources defines what Phase II armor is in prose or it's characteristics to then make the assumption off that trait that this character must be a clone. The reference note in turn would then need to source an entry/data of some kind (probably from USW or something) that details the characteristics of standard clone trooper armor, and state that it's the armor depicted in the comic, which would then make the character a clone, and not a normal trooper.'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 21:02, 8 April 2022 (UTC)

*<s>Shouldn't the first image be on the article's left and the last one on the article's right?</s>
**Not necessarily, no. The important thing is just that they alternate sides.
*<s>Using "the Sith councilor" repeatedly is repetitive. Could you use something like "the Sith" or the "Sith male" at some point to remove some repetivenes? {{C|And identify him as a male, of course}}</s> &mdash; '''''[[User:Samonic|Samonic]]''''' [[File:ChissAscendancyCanonSymbol.svg|20px]]  18:16, 6 May 2022 (UTC)
**Unfortunately, I do not believe that doing so would actually improve the article at all. Except for the Daragon twins, ''all'' of the characters mentioned in the article are Sith males. Note that I have actually already taken effort to vary the usage a bit where possible, referring to him as "(Sith) Councilor", "(Sith) Lord" and by the male pronoun "he". But at the end of the day, it's just one guy among many guys who all have the same attributes, and it's only their name (if applicable), appearance and actions that differentiate them. (And BTW, it's not mandatory to always explicitly say "male" if masculine pronouns do the trick.)

=====Imp=====
*<s>"''Located within the tangle of sharp, towering mountains, and plunging gorges and tall columns of the moon''" &mdash; this is rich Description info. Can you try and move at least some of it there?</s>
**Moved a bit to Description. Let me know if that's too much.
*<s>While you're at it, you should fix the dangling participle issue in that sentence: "''Located within the tangle of sharp, towering mountains, and plunging gorges and tall columns of the moon, Vassek 3 served as the location of the personal fortress of Kaleesh Separatist General Grievous.''" the ''fortress'', not ''Vassek 3'', was located within the tangle.</s>
**How's that?
*<s>Can we have consistency between referencing in infobox and the body?</s>
**Is that fine, or should I just cite it being in the Vassek system to the BMF issue?
***If the BMF issue gives the name for the system, that would allow you reduce the number of references used in that paragraph, yeah.
****Changed.
*<s>It's been a while since I last saw the episode, is the "his" here supposed to refer to Fisto or Vebb? "''his detachment of clone troopers''"</s>
**Yeah, I was referring to Vebb.
***Was Vebb actually a Jedi General? Before my copy-edit, you used to differentiate between Fisto and Vebb by referring to the latter as a Jedi Knight. I know there's next to no policy governing article subsection titles, but they probably shouldn't be misleading, so in case if Vebb isn't a General, "Encounter with Jedi Generals" should probably be something else.

*<s>Since it's so prominently visible in the image, do you think it's worth noting the vehicle Fisto arrived on Vassek 3 on? What about Vebb and the troopers, do we know about their vehicle of arrival?</s>
**Added both. I'll also try and get an image for the second subsection.
*<s>I'd like you try and rewrite the third paragraph of History so that it's presented from a more omniscient perspective (the reader should know upfront that it was Grievous's fortress that Fisto and Vebb entered).</s>
**Is that good? Added another paragraph because it felt like I was restricting the information.
*<s>A dictionary gives the meaning of the word "to coerce" as "To pressure, intimidate, or force (someone) into doing something." Are you sure this applies to Dooku's actions? I was under the impression that the Jedi were ''tricked'' into traveling to Vassek 3, which doesn't really fall under the definition of someone being "forced", I believe.</s> [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 16:45, 20 January 2022 (UTC)

*"''A depressing and gloomy structure filled with deadly traps, the looming fortress[1] was also home to Gor, the general's roggwart pet, and was maintained by at least five B1-series battle droids and Grievous's EV-series medical droid, EV-A4-D, who was responsible for carrying out any repairs on Grievous's damaged cybernetics, and protected by several IG-100 MagnaGuard droids.[3]''</s> Same with this one.

*Note that the reused Death Star background doesn't automatically mean that WED15-I7's necessarily on the Death Star IU, as cases such as ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' reusing Death Star footage are proof it's not a duck test scenario. Also notably another angle for the same model is shown among a lineup of droids on the Death Star in the ''[[Death Star Owner's Technical Manual]]'' book, but there's no evidence it's the same droid.

*<s>"''Sometime during 230 BBY, after arriving on the planet Dalna, the temporary stronghold of Kara Xoo's Tempest, Squib, a strike in the Tempest, entered the cargo hold of the Poisoned Barb, the flagship of Kara Xoo, the leader of the tempest, and pointed a blaster at the children inside, who had been kidnapped from their respective planets, ordering them to follow Yeet off the ship.''" Riiiight lets dissect this one. There's context for everything, that's good. Buuut, you've made so many clauses for it that it's just convoluted. So what I'm thinking is you move Kara Xoo's introduction up to that of the tempest and introduce them both together like "the tempest led by the Quarren Kara Xoo". With the children, you introduce them as "the" children as if we already know about. I'd say introduce them as something like "a group of kidnapped children" or "a group of children who had been&hellip;". And finally, you could just say "the strike Squib" to get rid of the extra clause. You contextualise stuff with clauses quite a lot so I, personally, would recommend trying to avoid (if there's a way to, of course) that just to keep the sentences less convoluted with parts.</s> [[User:Braha'tok enthusiast|<span style="color:#0047ab; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Braha'tok enthusiast</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Braha'tok enthusiast|<span style="color:#0047ab; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Hello there</span>]]</sup> 19:36, 24 March 2022 (UTC)
