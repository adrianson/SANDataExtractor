*I did some digging (and found a weird author on Amazon by the same name...), and while Worldcat has more than 300 publications under Williams, A. O., it's mostly scientific publication starting from the 1920s (ranging from electronics to acoustics to epidemics), but I could pinpoint Williams, A. O. the illustrator was active between 1981 and 1987, and by cross searching titles I also found him on the Bibliothque Nationale de France database, which allowed me to did ug his [[Wikipedia:International Standard Name Identifier|ISNI]]: https://isni.org/isni/0000000084017387 It's not of great interest, but still something that can be added to his external link.

*Note [[User:Imperators II|Imperators II's]] first objection on [[Wookieepedia:Comprehensive article nominations/Kelro]]. As with Kelro, the sources provide neither climate nor native life for Alkur, hence why it is not present on the article itself. [[User:DFaceG|DFaceG]] ([[User talk:DFaceG|talk]]) 12:28, 24 March 2022 (UTC)
**Addendum; "searing" counts as climate, per Imperators again. However, information regarding the planet's native life is still not present. [[User:DFaceG|DFaceG]] ([[User talk:DFaceG|talk]]) 12:35, 24 March 2022 (UTC)

=====Manoof=====
*The body is a bit confusing around the sequence of events. Can you clean it up a bit so the sequence is correct? If I understand correctly, Lumon directs/orders Andor to destroy Kenobi's ship, Kenobi requests Andor to destory him at the right moment, which Andor complies with? This doesn't seem to make sense why he would delay, especially when it explicitly states Andor would not delay. Does the source clarify? [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 05:52, 13 June 2022 (UTC)
**That's the right order, Kenobi wants to time the [[Ejector seat/Legends|ejector seat]] --[[User:Goodmind|Goodmind]] ([[User talk:Goodmind|talk]]) 06:04, 13 June 2022 (UTC)
***So that needs to be made clearer, you mention Kenobi contacting Andor, then mention Andor would destroy it without hesitation, then Kenobi persuading Andor. [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 06:31, 13 June 2022 (UTC)
*"planet's explosive moon's" needs to be reworded as it is currently saying the moon is exposive [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 05:52, 13 June 2022 (UTC)
**That's right, the moon has explosive ore --[[User:Goodmind|Goodmind]] ([[User talk:Goodmind|talk]]) 06:04, 13 June 2022 (UTC)
***Yes, but the moon itself isn't explosive [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 06:31, 13 June 2022 (UTC)
*discredit would be to bring doubt to Kenobi's claims, but it sounds like the droid was wanting to kill Kenobi, so is this the right word choice and does it need further clarification/context? [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 05:52, 13 June 2022 (UTC)
**Not sure what you mean --[[User:Goodmind|Goodmind]] ([[User talk:Goodmind|talk]]) 06:04, 13 June 2022 (UTC)
***You say the droid was planted to discredit Kenobi, but it had sabotaged his vessel. That's sabotage or a failed assassination attempt rather than discrediting Kenobi, if it is discrediting his abilities or capabilities or the Republic's decision in sending him or something that needs to be explained. [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 06:31, 13 June 2022 (UTC)

**Not necessarily, since even though he split from his family, he, a human, had been part of it at some point.

*** As mentioned on Discord, we shouldn't consider Bansu Ro as no longer part of that family. We know he split from them, as I understand that means he simply didn't join them in joining the rebels and cut communication with them, which may have been to protect them. Family by blood is still family so kinda thinking he should be noted as part of that family, though estranged from the REST of the family. They're still part of their original family, even insofar that if they were to map their family tree they would show those aspects they have cut off.

*Note I've left the TIE Fighter issues out of the appearances since Ro has "split" from his family by then (which I believe applies to his visual depiction in the comics as well). Feel free to object if you believe that shouldn't be the case.

*Is there a precedent for assuming that any mention of "rebels" is not synonymous with the Rebel Alliance? [[User:Commander Code-8|<b><span style="color: Purple">Commander Code-8</span></b>]] <sup>[[User talk:Commander Code-8|<span style="color: Maroon">Hello There!</span>]]</sup> 08:29, 25 July 2022 (UTC)
**The logic I've gone with is that not all rebel groups were part of the Alliance. [[Partisans]] and [[Batonn insurgency]] being the best example. It's also not specified when he split from his family, could be before the founding off the official Alliance. Given he's in the academy not long before Endor, that's probably not likely, but there's still no solid timing for me to go off of.

*<s>Would like to know how ''Labyrinth of Evil'' mentions the battle, which may or may not warrant the Imo tag currently used. In fact, do none of the other Legends sources at least provide a name that could be used for the article title?</s> [[User:Shayanomer|<span style="color:#DEB40D">'''Shayanomer'''</span>]] [[File:Din Djarin's clan.svg|15px]] ([[User talk:Shayanomer|<span style="color:#A06800">'''talk'''</span>]]) 03:23, 9 May 2022 (UTC)
**It mentions the engagement as "With his homeworld threatened" in ''Labyrinth of Evil''. ''The New Essential Chronology'' uses "final assault on the Neimoidian homeworld," but the other three are all indirect mentions.

====Comments====
*Wouldn't it be more appropriate for the conjectural title to be "battle on Neimoidia" since as far as I know we typically avoid "of" in conjectural battle names.

*If battle on Phorsa Gedd is the official name it should be capitalized, other wise it should be "a battle" instead of "the battle". -[[User:ThrawnChiss7|ThrawnChiss7]] ([[User talk:ThrawnChiss7|talk]]) 20:59, 12 May 2022 (UTC)
**That is incorrect. We should only follow the source's capitalization and not introduce any changes from our side. There is ample precedent for naming events as such.

*<s>Is it sure that it happened before the High Republic Era, or could it have also happened during it?

**The book is pretty clear that all of the artifacts in the ''[[Secrets of the Jedi]]'' exhibit are "ancient" and otherwise old. Since ''The Rising Storm'' is set circa 231 BBY and the High Republic Era is supposed to have begun around 300 BBY, I would say that the intent is clearly that all of the artifacts predate that era. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 18:40, 22 January 2022 (UTC)
***Sorry to chime in, but that no longer appears to be the case consdiering phase 2 is going to be set 150 years before phase 1, so that would be 380ish BBY [[User:Lewisr|Lewisr]] ([[User talk:Lewisr|talk]]) 18:45, 22 January 2022 (UTC)
****Point taken. Even so, artifacts from the 1860s-1870s aren't generally considered "ancient" IRL, in fact artifacts from the Middle Ages aren't considered ancient. Old, yes, but not ancient. Given the descriptions used for the stuff in ''Secrets of the Jedi'', the implication that they predate the High Republic Era by a significant margin still stands. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 18:51, 22 January 2022 (UTC)
*****I understand your point, but I still think "by" is the safest option since it could be prior to or during, which would completely avoid speculating.

*At my discretion, I have felt like mentioning Talosh was President of the [[Derf Chapter]] of the [[Max Rebo Fan Club]] isn't necessary for this article. Also I'm aware of the similar name as the already-famous before the Insider article Blue Man Group, but didn't feel like it's obvious enough. [[User:Hanzo Hasashi|Hanzo Hasashi]] ([[User talk:Hanzo Hasashi|talk]]) 03:03, 12 August 2022 (UTC)
**Disagree on the Blue Man Group, my first thought was that it was a RL article on the actual group, not an IU article. Plus it's nearly identical in name except for the possessive apostrophe. So yeah I think it should be mentioned in the BTS, even if it wasn't directly referenced by the author [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 06:17, 12 August 2022 (UTC)
***Done. [[User:Hanzo Hasashi|Hanzo Hasashi]] ([[User talk:Hanzo Hasashi|talk]]) 13:19, 12 August 2022 (UTC)
*It was my further discretion that, in light of myself being uncertain on if Tik Tali Talosh is the "Stop That Jawa!" character, to remove his species, as I don't have any awareness of it being necessary to mention a character's species for articles about their publications as is. This is ultimately driven by my individual uncertainty about if he's the comic character because, if he is, the 3 legs would definitely make him seemingly a Humanoid alien species... [[User:Hanzo Hasashi|Hanzo Hasashi]] ([[User talk:Hanzo Hasashi|talk]]) 00:09, 15 August 2022 (UTC)
**Rich Handley confirmed he's the comic character. I'm definitely treating him as a non-Human now, given the 3 legs from the comic. [[User:Hanzo Hasashi|Hanzo Hasashi]] ([[User talk:Hanzo Hasashi|talk]]) 04:39, 15 August 2022 (UTC)

*<s>The date ref places the event 'in 52 BBY', while the prose of the article says 'around 52 BBY'. Which is correct? Though, actually, given that the part of the mention is only established under Dooku being 'fifty-something' (could be a 9 year range, in theory) in the introduction to Part Five, more firm dating might be found in that it's some point after Averross's training ends and just prior to Jinn's apprenticeship, which can be dated since the age at which he's apprenticed is known.</s>'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 14:26, 27 March 2022 (UTC)

===Vote to remove nomination (EC only)===
#{{EC}} Despite having successfully nominated 7 CAs, the nominator has seemingly failed to apply what they could have learnt from those nominations here. This is clearly demonstrated in the many spelling and grammatical errors throughout the [[Celestial]] article, which violates rule 1 of [[WP:CAN]]. If you cannot learn to apply the standards of your own status articles by yourself to your own nominations, then I highly recommend that you at least let people help you via [[Wookieepedia:Discord|Discord]] or [[Wookieepedia:IRC|IRC]]. It is not acceptable to continually nominate articles that fall so glaringly short of Wookieepedia's status article standards.

*I have been unable to find a source that I think is reliable enough to use to back his birthday and nationality. There's widely repeated information on Wikipedia and IMDB but I don't think they count as substantial.

*As noted in my objection, there are inconsistencies in status articles as the use in External links of "Official website" ([[Little Corvus]], [[Megan Ilnitzki]], [[Daniel M. Lavery]], [[Jenny Parks]]) versus "Official site" ([[Stephen Byrne]], [[Yihyoung Li]], [[Viv Tanner]], [[Angela Morley]]). Let's use this occasion to settle this. I'm personally partial to "Official website" which I've been using for a while, and is also written as such in several internet citation templates too. --[[User:NanoLuuke|<span style="color: #FF4500;">'''NanoLuuke'''</span>]]<sup>[[User_talk:NanoLuuke|<span style="color: #000000;">Cloning facility</span>]]</sup> 10:43, 17 February 2022 (UTC)

**Nope, this scene is in fact 11 months after Endor at the start of the novel. The gist is that the Imperial loyalist forces are mostly at Jakku at this point while those that chose to go rogue are at the Chrenthoan Abyss, Anoat sector and so on. The only parts of the novel that are post Jakku is the much smaller 4th part of the book, which I would count as sort of a series of epilogue sections as they each have time jumps ranging up to several years in between them.

***So from your answer I'm getting that Jakku occurred ''after'' the appearance of the Chrenthoan Abyss, in which case I'd like you to make that more clear in the ref note so that the possibility that the appearance of the Abyss is in 6 ABY is eliminated.

**I've changed the wording. What is wrong with having to articles that are the same? Literally the same information is known about them, so why can't the articles be the same?

***Firstly, just copying article text across different articles without attribution is technically a violation of the license you're submitting your edits under. Secondly, having identical content across multiple articles hurts the site's SEO.

*******Yeah, it was lacking a more specific archival date, which I've now added (on Archive.org, you can browse all the instances where a given webpage has been archived through the captures calendar accessible from the top bar). Ultimately, of course, it's all moot since Hyperspace was a subscription-based service that was obsoleted years ago, so all the info from that article comes from personal copies people have saved. But back to your article. Please make sure that only that sentence is referenced to "The Written Word," as it cannot support the rest of the info you currently have sourced to it. Also, it seems to me the letter's name should be lowercase, similarly to how the spelled-out names of the letters of real-world alphabets such as Greek are lowercase.

********Thanks for the explanation. (Grek is now lowercase, and and only that sentence is sourced to "The Written Word." and the rest to ''The Essential Atlas''.) -[[User:ThrawnChiss7|ThrawnChiss7]] ([[User talk:ThrawnChiss7|talk]])

***Irrespective of the TC, we shouldn't be definitively stating that there are 7 unless it is mentioned, we could potentially say that Baobab knew of 7.

=====Macaroni=====
*<s>Based on the quote, it doesn't seem like Baobab considered Grek to be ''the'' farthest out, just that it's among a group of galaxies that is "much farther out."

**TEA says the companion galaxies where ordered, with Companion Aurek being the first, and then Besh. I think it is clear that the ordered follows the Aurubesh alphabet and that there are 7 of them, but it seems others think otherwise, and so it is now changed to just be "much farther" out. -[[User:ThrawnChiss7|ThrawnChiss7]] ([[User talk:ThrawnChiss7|talk]]) 20:56, 13 June 2022 (UTC)

**That's in regard to the reception in the Chancellor's office.

**'''Nexus of power''': (Context about the plasma refinery complex) ...Damask Holdings joint venture to expand plasma refining on Naboo. A massive, triple-domed complex that blends in...
**'''Build the Millennium Falcon 17''': (Mustafar information and history) ...Many rival organizations have exploited Mustafar's mineral wealth. Damask  Holdings established a base on the planet before the Clone Wars...

*****Honestly, when it concerns a planet/moon/station in a star system, a dot on a galactic-scale map can never ''not'' refer to the system&mdash;at that scale, they're just indistinguishably small. (After all, referring to dots like that on large-scale maps as "planets" is really just a characteristic of science fiction/space operas in general, since in real-world astronomy the fact that there was a ''star system'' there is equally&mdash;if not even more&mdash;important as the fact that a particular planet was located there. :) ) Whether it ''also'' refers to the specific object within the system is then subject to how we treat the specific map or the general works in which the maps are found.

*The text reads as follows: 'Due to its violently adverse effects on several species, Gamorrean "detonator ale" is banned across much of the known galaxy.' Since it's 'Gamorrean "detonator ale"' and not 'Gamorrean detonator ale', I'm interpreting that to mean explicit confirmation that the liquour is produced by the Gamorreans rather than Gamorrean being part of the name.

**Valorum did become Chancellor eventually, but didn't get it this run. Part of why it's omitted is that it's not known who won this election cycle in 40 BBY; sometime prior to 32 BBY, Skor Kalpana is the next individual known to have gotten it, and Valorum ends up working for Kalpana at some point and then getting the Chancellery himself later. Though, there's an 8 year gap where the title isn't known to be held by someone specific, so Elissiar could've very well won or lost. If necessary, I could specify that Valorum later got Chancellor in a different election, but given the brief context of Elissiar's mention, it seemed irrelevant, as Jinn's thoughts don't tie them together particularly much.'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 05:32, 27 March 2022 (UTC)

=====OOM=====
*I don't think this is actually notable enough to warrant an article of its own. As far as I can see, there is no information about the funeral itself other than the fact that it took place.

====Comments====
*"With so much attention being focused on the election, stories that  might otherwise have been viewed as significant escaped notice. One such story was the unexpected death of reclusive Muun financier Hego Damask. Hastily prepared obituaries contained the few facts about his life that were public knowledge but scarcely touched on the behind-the-scenes role he had played in shaping the history of the Republic. Members of the InterGalactic Banking Clan were '''refusing to release any information''' about the '''funeral''' or about the disposition of Damasks substantial holdings on Muunilinst and dozens of other worlds. Off the record, beings remarked that the intricacies of the Muuns business concerns might take decades to unravel." &mdash; '''''[[User:Samonic|Samonic]]''''' [[File:ChissAscendancyCanonSymbol.svg|20px]]  10:41, 3 May 2022 (UTC)

***So say it's a type of bird. Type is not synonymous with species, which is a specific taxonomic rank. Hawks are a type of bird, but not a species of bird, they're classified as a family. I realize this is something we're often lax on, even in our category names, but we should certainly avoid it's use in body unless specified.

=====Erebus=====
*Author for ''Light of the Jedi''.
*"The Great Sith War was a war..." mentioning that it was a war is redundant to the name, similarly to how star systems and sectors aren't written "The D'Astan sector was a sector..."
*BTS should include that the comic was an issue of the [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (miniseries)|''Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi'']] comic series. [[User:Erebus Chronus|<b><span style="color:#3e236e">Erebus Chronus</span></b>]] <sup>[[User talk:Erebus Chronus|<b><span style="color:#3e236e">(Talk)</span></b>]]</sup> 15:33, 30 April 2022 (UTC)

=====Imp=====
*Let this be a lesson to yourself and other editors who want to nominate for status Canon counterparts of Legends subjects - do not simply assume that the corresponding Legends articles are correct, ''especially'' if they themselves have not been brought to status. In this case, the Legends Great Sith War ''did not'', in fact, begin&mdash;and therefore first appear&mdash;in ''Tales of the Jedi'' 2. In fact, I suspect the publication history for the Legends Great Sith Wars is actually quite intricate. This will have to be investigated in order to correctly reflect it in this article's BTS.
*The Legends Great Sith War article also indicates a first mention for the subject; if correct, that should be documented in the Canon article's BTS, as well. [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 10:26, 2 May 2022 (UTC)
*In addition, ''[[Nexus of Power]]'', which Wookieepedia treats as [[Wookieepedia:Canon policy/Fantasy Flight Games|both Canon and Legends]] features the [[Qel-Droma Epics]], which [[in-universe]] describe events that in Legends are central elements of the Great Sith War. Even if Canon has yet to establish an in-universe connection between the Great Sith War and the Qel-Droma Epics, I'd still like to see this noted in the BTS. [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 14:46, 2 May 2022 (UTC)
**The legends great sith war article was a featured article in 2012, and so the first appearance section should be accurate. -[[User:ThrawnChiss7|ThrawnChiss7]] ([[User talk:ThrawnChiss7|talk]]) 21:11, 2 May 2022 (UTC)
***2012 was quite a long time ago, at least in terms of Wookieepedia status articles - status article quality standards were significantly lower back then. Besides, this isn't really relevant at all since it is demonstrably wrong to list ''Tales of the Jedi'' 2 as the first appearance of the Great Sith War. Unfortunately I have to suggest that you withdraw this nomination until you or someone else can fully investigate the proper publication history of the Legends Great Sith War so that it can be accurately reflected on this article. [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 21:26, 2 May 2022 (UTC)
****How is it wrong? Does the Great Sith War not appear in ''Tales of the Jedi'' 2, or does it appear in an earlier source ? -[[User:ThrawnChiss7|ThrawnChiss7]] ([[User talk:ThrawnChiss7|talk]]) 22:17, 2 May 2022 (UTC)
*****Under the latest Legends canon, the Great Sith War only began with events depicted in later sources. That being said, I strongly suspect that that definition has changed over time. In addition, there's also the matter of the name, since the conflict isn't referred to as such during the original sources, so it must have originated in some other source, plus it's been referred to both as "Great Sith War" and simply the "Sith War", and I've yet to determine which one came first.

*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]'' mentions Sy and Greeata were for "a period of time performing in cantinas as a duo, but one night an Ortolan named Max Rebo&mdash;the keyboard player in a band led by Evar Orbus&mdash;witnessed their act." Notably the location also being a cantina, as opposed to unrelatedly being discovered by Rebo in that source alone, isn't obvious. But combined with Greeata's Databank (2001) saying that they were discovered in a cantina by Rebo, I'm counting the first book as first mention.

=====Manoof=====
*<s>"''Grysks' threat to the Chiss Ascendancy, his people, and the Galactic Empire.''" reads as if the chiss ascendancy and his people are two different groups. Are you able to rephrase this, perhaps mentioning the ascendancy earlier? [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 12:58, 16 March 2022 (UTC)</s>
*<s>The last sentence is redundant [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 12:58, 16 March 2022 (UTC)</s>
*<s>It reads like they were encroaching into Imperial space, is that also in the Unknown regions?

[[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 12:58, 16 March 2022 (UTC)</s>
*<s>Can we split this beefy paragraph in two? Probably from "In 1 BBY..." [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 13:10, 16 March 2022 (UTC)</s>

*<s>Use of four &mdash;es in the first sentence is a bit overkill and should be rephrased or broken into multiple sentences. [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 13:28, 18 March 2022 (UTC)</s>

*<s>In the last sentence, using "he" at the start is unclear who it is referring to. You need to introduce the subject first, and ensure there can be no misinterpretation on who "he/they/her/them/etc" could be referring to. Eg you wouldn't say "John, Jacob and james were in the car, then he got out" [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 13:28, 18 March 2022 (UTC)</s>

*<s>re's 100% a quote you can use here.

*Take a look at [[Unidentified veteran clone trooper]]'s BTS:
**"First appeared" is unnecessary, remove it.
**Missing director.
**Specify that Kenobi is a live action limited series.
**"albeit just their voice" should be (remember the article is conjectural) "The contact appeared, albeit voice only,..." (Thanks Manoof!)

*Estree being paid isn't really relevant to his associate.
*Haja Estree's contact" is conjectural, and therefore, that should not be bolded. Something like "A male individual was '''associated''' with Haja Estree..." (The article should be moved to Haja Estree's associate, he's not really a contact in the spaceport. He's a member of Estree's scam)

**We don't know they were. We know that the planet had the High King's Guard, and M'Toc served it.

=====Silver=====
*<s>I have to ask, why is the article's title conjectural when Hunter literally calls it the "insurrection on Yalbec Prime" word-for-word?</s>
**It's conjectural because it's not the actual name. Hunter's only stating that they were involved in an insurrection that took place on Yalbec Prime, detailing what the event is. That's why it's conjectural.
*<s>''If'' the conjecture tag stays, the article's first sentence would flow better if it was reworded to begin by stating the year it happened and that it was the last year of the Clone Wars, before bringing up the insurrection and CF99's involvement. If the tag goes, it should be changed to start "The insurrection on Yalbec Prime..." before mentioning that it happened in the last year of the war and the other details.</s>

*Hunter should be included in the participants list

*<s>The tweet doesn't seem to support the birth year.

**The tweet does support the birth year. Manning used emojis to make the number "24" signifying his 24th birthday at the time.

**Done.
**Done.
**The subject was first mentioned in an exact, word-for-word identical, excerpt of the finished novel ''The Rising Storm'' published on StarWars.com. Thus, the novel is the first extant material to mention the subject. The excerpt's existence is mentioned in the BTS, and I think that does just fine.

**There is no information provided in the sources for Kelro's climate, or even its native life. All we know is that it was "useless" and a "desolate, searing rock."

***Yes there is - it's stated that the planet is searing hot - that's temperature, which is an aspect of climate.

*In terms of who made this song, unclear IU if this was written by The Palpatones, or if it was a preexisting song for which the band just did a cover. Because it's unclear if written by The Palpatones, which formed 4 ABY at the earliest, this song may have been written before 4 ABY, if it wasn't written by the group known to perform it.

*<s>For the record, per the comments below, I don't believe that the twins having two different homeworlds is necessarily a contradiction.</s> [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 08:11, 11 January 2022 (UTC)
**I added a bit to the BTS about the possibility that they do have two homeworlds, which should probably do the trick here. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 17:34, 11 January 2022 (UTC)
***I'm sorry, but I don't agree with the idea that we should assume something is a contradiction if it ''isn't necessarily one''. I'm sure Imri Cantaros is not the only ''Star Wars'' character out there with more than one homeworld. We should be only be resorting to judging something a contradiction if it cannot be reasonably assumed to ''not'' be one. This is an approach that, I might add as an example, we are using with articles on roleplaying game subject matter - if two things aren't mutually exclusive, we generally assume that both hold true. [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 17:43, 11 January 2022 (UTC)
****Okay, reworded that. I assume by your comments that you don't agree with the {{Tl|Twoconflicting}} template's presence either? I'm still mulling over what I should or should not do about that in light of your objections. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 17:48, 11 January 2022 (UTC)
*****I propose that, yes, you remove the header template and simply note in the body that Kotab was one of the two homeworlds of the twins, the other being Sagamore. [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 18:17, 11 January 2022 (UTC)
******Done. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 18:26, 11 January 2022 (UTC)
*******And now there's no need for the last two sentences of the BTS, either. [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 08:49, 12 January 2022 (UTC)

====Comments====
*Do the two conflicting sources say that Ceret and Terec were ''born'' on Kotab/Sagamore? Or just that it was their homeworld/they were "from there"? [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 08:46, 9 January 2022 (UTC)
**The wording in the article is "Hailing from the planet Kotab". The book mentions the twins as being from Sagamore in a context indicating it is supposed to be their homeworld. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 08:48, 9 January 2022 (UTC)
***Right. But individuals in ''Star Wars'' can have more than one homeworld, can't they? (As long as the word isn't used in the sense of the place of birth.) [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 08:53, 9 January 2022 (UTC)
****That's true, remembering [[Imri Cantaros]]. I'm not sure if that's the intent in this case, however, but I'll see what I can do. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 08:56, 9 January 2022 (UTC)

*Seems like [[humanoid]] is infobox/description-only atm, can it be added to the bio? Same with Krane's gender, is only pipelinked to a pronoum at the moment.
*The intro and description seem to conflict slightly in wording. Was she ''placed'' in charge of Auger, or take/force command it over for herself?
*"However, this endeavor made her reckless and when hiding the relic in a cave she became trapped when it collapsed, dying." Seems to read a bit run-on, I'm not sure if it's just where the punctuation is placed or otherwise.

**Added, though this objection hasn't been made on other Lazerian system planet nominations. I'm not contesting the objection, but I am curious about this inconsistency.

**Removed. [[User:DFaceG|DFaceG]] ([[User talk:DFaceG|talk]]) 18:41, 11 March 2022 (UTC)
*<s>Please note in the BTS the author of the chapter on Lazerian IV per the book's table of contents.
*The Lazerian system was already mentioned in ''The Essential Atlas'', so you should switch that for the Online Companion in the BTS as the original work that introduced the system's coordinates.
*Per Good article precedent [[Adriana|here]], we're assuming that any hyperlanes that are connected to a given star system also apply to its constituent planets, therefore you should add to the infobox and body of this article that Lazerian VII, along with the rest of the Lazerian system, was situated on the [[Harrin Trade Corridor]] and [[Kira Run]] hyperlanes per the map in ''Twin Stars of Kira''.
*Per ''The Essential Atlas'', the Lazerian system, and therefore Lazerian VII, is specifically located in the [[Trailing Sectors/Legends|Trailing Sectors]] portion of the Expansion Region. Please add this information to the infobox and the body. See [[Roldalna]] for status article precedent on how to do that. (This article is already in the [[:Category:Trailing Sectors planets|Trailing Sectors planets]] category because the Kira sector planets one is a subcategory of that one.)
*I don't see the last sentence of the article as necessary. You've already noted the planet's orbital position (=seventh), and providing an explicit list of all the system's orbital bodies is more of a job for the Lazerian system article.</s> [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 19:17, 11 March 2022 (UTC)

*<s>Needs Onyx disambig [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 12:45, 12 March 2022 (UTC)</s>
*Imperial starfighters and TIE Defender categories missing (As a side note, onyx 1 and 2 seem to be missing the callsign category?). Will check Onyx 1 once these are addressed so you can fix any similar issues ahead of time :) [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 12:45, 12 March 2022 (UTC)
**I also mentioned in Discord that Onyx Leader is used as an apparent call sign, while Onyx 1 and Onyx 2 (for that matter, also [[Onyx Four]]) are individual ship names. Others fixed. [[User:Hanzo Hasashi|Hanzo Hasashi]] ([[User talk:Hanzo Hasashi|talk]]) 15:56, 12 March 2022 (UTC)
***Looking at Brath's card and [https://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.fandom.com/wiki/Lyttan_Dree Lyttan Dree's card], I'm confused how you differentiate between which is a callsign and which is the ship? [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 12:28, 13 March 2022 (UTC)

====Comments====
*Note I only included the things that specifically use the Onyx Leader name for sources. ''[[The New Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessels]]'' and {{CSWECite|II|414|Onyx Squadron}} don't mention the call sign, even though both mention Brath's role leading the squadron. [[User:Hanzo Hasashi|Hanzo Hasashi]] ([[User talk:Hanzo Hasashi|talk]]) 01:42, 9 March 2022 (UTC)
*Also note that the exact image was used earlier for another card for Brath. However, with real life examples I can think about with people in law enforcement, they sometimes have current photos representing them not at the position they currently hold, but a previous one. Similar examples used for ones who are memorialized after line of duty deaths. There's no evidence that Brath immediately went to Onyx Squadron when he first started flying a Defender, so it's possible that he's not even serving that squadron at the time of that IU image.

**Expanded the topic but I really don't see how one could misconstrue the paper as having Londahl's name.

=====Crofyp-of-war=====
*<s>Preliminaries</s>
**Please note ''Legends'' counterpart in the BTS.
**Source the BTS.
**Mention Ers'ikaro's ''Bellicose''.
**I think Jixtus said something about man-of-wars.
**You should mention when man-of-wars were used.
**Specify when Ar'alani commanded the ''Vigilant''.
**Missing links to engine, hyperdrive, commanding officer. [[User:Samonic|'''Samonic''']] [[File:Signatureicon.png|20px]] <sup>[[User talk:Samonic|'''(Talk)''']]</sup> 08:04, 21 September 2022 (UTC)
*<s>Second wave</s>
**Please specify when Ers'ikaro and Dy'lothe commanded their man-of-wars.
**Did Ar'alani command the ''Vigilant'' only in 19 BBY? Please reword, as she also commanded it around 18 BBY.
**A source isn't an appearance, but a mention, so the BTS part regarding the ''Heir to the Empire'' sourcebook must be reworded.
**Please mention Picket Force Six in both infobox and body.
**Please mention engines, laser turrets, electrostatic barriers, hull, escape pods, docking bays, etc. Some of these are infobox-exclusive as of now.
**Ers'ikaro and Dy'lothe aren't CEDF admirals, but CDF admirals. [[Chiss Defense Force]] should be linked instead of [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Force]] (Legends.)
**Do we know how long the man-of-wars were? Slightly smaller than the ''[[FateSpinner]]''?
**Please specify that the man-of-wars first appeared in the current ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[canon]] when mentioning Chaos Rising. {{C|You can check [[Yashuvhu]] for an example}} [[User:Samonic|'''Samonic''']] [[File:Signatureicon.png|20px]] <sup>[[User talk:Samonic|'''(Talk)''']]</sup> 15:59, 24 September 2022 (UTC)

**Electrostatic barrier shouldn't be capitalized in the body.
**Underlinking: missing links to [[hull]], [[deflector shield]], [[standard year]] and [[weapon]].
**We don't know if ar'alani stopped commanding her nigthdragon between 19-18 bby, please reword.
**Can you say that the breachers were missiles? "breacher missiles" will do.

**Thanks, you're right about the category. As for the war infobox, for understandable reasons it only has fields for the sides of the conflict (e.g., the Galactic Empire, whereas the Imperial Army is merely a military branch of the Empire, not a side of its own) and commanders (we don't know in what capacity Tagge served at that point).

*"Authorities" shouldn't link to the Coruscant Security Force as the diner was on Stobar.
*There appear to be 4-5 other waitress droids identical to Marwigo that also appear in the episode. When the police droid tells Anakin "We have it under control, sir," you can see four in the background, and you also see four or so further back while Savage is choking Sassi. As such, I'm not sure the droid who drops her tray is the same one that Loubo tells to call the authorites.

*<s>Rim-based planets needs a tad more context, as in none of the Rims are mentioned earlier in the article</s>
**I was describing the Loyalist faction, not the Militarists. 
***What I'm meaning is that there's currently no context for what a Rim-based planet is, just needs to say something about the Rims being most of the central regions of the galaxy, or you just list the Rims being referred to there.

*Does "year round" refer to any specific time frame? If not, you could just put it as "at any time" because this is the apparent meaning. [[User:Loqiical|Loqiical]] ([[User talk:Loqiical|talk]]) 08:49, 1 March 2022 (UTC)
**I think the current phrasing is fine, it's what the book uses and is no different to saying something like "I eat turkey all year round, not just at Christmas". [[User:Ayrehead02|Ayrehead02]] ([[User talk:Ayrehead02|talk]]) 09:11, 1 March 2022 (UTC)
***I just noted this because different in-universe locations in the galaxy can have different years, but the current meaning just seems to be "at any time [in a standard year]" or something like that. Thanks. [[User:Loqiical|Loqiical]] ([[User talk:Loqiical|talk]]) 03:14, 2 March 2022 (UTC)

=====Samonic's original objections section=====
*<s>The family is the main topic of this article, therefore, Thurfian's leverage isn't what should be mentioned first. Instead, you should mention that around 19 BBY, the family was troubled because of several mineral's price change. Then, you would mention Mitth family Syndic's talk with Thalias.
*''"informed Thalias of her former family, and how a recent change in price of certain minerals pressed hard on them.''" &mdash; he didnt really inform her of the family, only of the trouble they were having due to the price changes, please reword.
*''" she would betray information on Senior Captain Thrawn,"'' So, Thalias betrayed the information? Please reword this so it reads like she would betray Senior Captain Thrawn and would give Thurfian information that would allow him to remove Thrawn from the Mitth.
*You must mention that Thalias was taken ''from'' the family to become a sky-walker and that Thurfian offered to give the family what they needed if the caregiver gave him the information he desired.
*Please mention that the Chiss Ascendancy was the Chiss species' nation or mention the Chiss species in the first sentence.
*Missing pipelink to [[reproduction]] and [[Chiss family]] {{C|<nowiki>[[Reproduction|born]]</nowiki>}} Missing this [[:Category:Unidentified families|category]].
*Context for Colonial Station Camco.
*No mention of who Senior Captain Thawn* is affiliated with.</s> '''[[User:Samonic|<font style="color:#bd730b;">'''Samonic'''</font>]]''' [[File:ChissAscendancyCanonSymbol.svg|20px]] 16:57, 30 August 2022 (UTC)

*<s>I'm not a fan of listing the TPBs in the sources section.

**Per the discussion on Discord, OOU listing of reprints is different than IU. IU articles do list reprints when it comes to reference books that are "updated and expanded." With things like the TPBs, there can be new content available, and collections like TPBs or hardcovers are different than a straight up reprint with no change in content, or a simple abridged eBook like I talked about [[Forum:SH:Disney-Lucasfilm Press eBooks|here]]. Plus, we have precedent of status articles passing with TPBs included, such as with [[J.J. Kirby]] or [[Stephen Byrne]]. Technically, Bustos' name and cover aren't featured until a gallery very end of the TPB, not with the comic issue itself. Should I change the mention in her sources section such that it just mentions the TPB and not the individual issue contained therein? [[User:Dentface|Dentface]] ([[User talk:Dentface|talk]]) 04:18, 14 February 2022 (UTC)

*Didn't include the 17km in the infobox because the source uses both "tall" and "long," which is confusing. Also, having a 17km tall spire doesn't prevent the station from also having an even taller one that is simply not mentioned.

*Not really an objection, but why do you call it a world instead of a planet? I thought we assumed that "world" meant that something was a planet? [[User:VergenceScatter|VergenceScatter]] ([[User talk:VergenceScatter|talk]]) 16:54, 13 August 2022 (UTC)
**Because in the case of "world" vs "planet" I prefer to stick to the exact wording used by the source. And while yes, we assume that "world" means "planet" there's nothing saying that one or the other word specifically must be used.

*<s>This sentence has way too many parentheticals and is thus very hard to follow, please reword: "''After the leader of the Illumine, Generalirius Nakirre, was killed by Jixtus, Nakirre's former ally, the Pathfinder navigator of the Whetstone, Qilori, ordered a Kilji vassal, one of Nakirre's enlightened servants who followed the Kilji beliefs, to remove the peace-sealing to fire at Jixtus' flagship, the FateSpinner, in an attempt to kill Jixtus.''"</s>

*Can date of death not be pinpointed to some range? [[User:Hanzo Hasashi|Hanzo Hasashi]] ([[User talk:Hanzo Hasashi|talk]]) 20:09, 4 August 2022 (UTC)
**Not the nominator, but I think that would depend on whether or not we know when his training was. He could have died in service as an Imperial Commando, or it could have been Republic era. We simply don't know enough about RC-8028, unless we assumed him to be the same clone as [[Two-Eight]], which, given the circumstances, I can both see reasoning for and reasoning against. [[User:DFaceG|DFaceG]] ([[User talk:DFaceG|talk]]) 20:21, 4 August 2022 (UTC)
***Of note, this isn't the only time that book does such things. [[RX-4-9]] would seem to have been intended as [[EX-4-9]], while [[DS-75-5]] seems to have been intended as [[DS-73-5]]. [[User:Hanzo Hasashi|Hanzo Hasashi]] ([[User talk:Hanzo Hasashi|talk]]) 20:27, 4 August 2022 (UTC)
****Given the source, I feel that it's too ambiguous to give a set date, as is combining [[Two-Eight]] and RC-8028. If this was a recently released piece of media we might have a chance at getting it answered, but we caught the discrepancy far too late for that sadly. [[User:TK-462|TK-462]] ([[User talk:TK-462|talk]]) 21:11, 4 August 2022 (UTC)
*Please see my [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/RC-8028?curid=56146&diff=11629647&oldid=11621502 edit]. Also, while DFaceG is correct in pointing out the precedent that a character's species and gender is specified in opening sentences, it isn't a hard and fast rule, and in fact I think sometimes articles can suffer from being so programmatic. For an article of this length, you don't need to mention "Human male" until the very last sentence since that is where the traits applicable to all clone troopers are specified.

*<s>I've looked at the source, and it seems to me that you should try and go more closely here with what it actually says. It establishes the existence of ''two'' subsequent yet different subjects: the pre-(super)nova Redhurne star and its post-nova remnant. The star is not described as being white, the ''remnant'' is. And you should also incorporate all those tiny details that are still relevant to the remnant - that it was a collapsed fragment of a star, that it had an intense white glow, and that it emitted radiation that was lethal to unshielded life-forms.</s>
**Ah ok. I had seen it interpreted as a white dwarf star but that would've been an assumption so I thought that writing it as if it was in a new transition state would have worked. I've switched it up now.
*<s>I'm also seeing in the novel a mention of at least one moon in the Redhurne system. On star articles, we generally try to go in-depth on the bodies that orbited them ([[Jaska|example]]), so you should note that, too. Are there any other peculiar bodies orbiting the star that are mentioned?</s>
**Incorporated. Since the ''Apailana's Promise'' hid behind a planet fragment turned asteroid I've made sure to make use of that info too.
***I'm seeing in the novel that the moon was situated at the system's edge and was "shattered" and "broken". I'll leave it up to you whether to note the latter fact in this article (since the moon could have been&mdash;however unlikely&mdash;shattered prior to the supernova and therefore it could be more pertinent to note it in the Redhurne system article), but I think mentioning the former fact is relevant enough to the star.

*<s>"''now no sign remained on those planets' ravaged surfaces of life or civilization.''" &mdash; I'm interpreting this as meaning that the planets previously did host life-forms and/or sentient beings, which would be notable information for the star (for example, whether a star is able to host life in its star system is a big deal in real-life astronomy). What do you think?</s> [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 00:32, 26 January 2022 (UTC)
**My interpretation was that whatever was formally on the worlds has been wiped out, but I do get your point with the mention of life and civilisation. I'll give you the call on that.

***My point is, that wording to me implies that prior to going supernova the star didn't host a ''lifeless'' system (again, a big deal in real life, for example), which I'd like to see reflected in the article.

=====OOM=====
*It's best to avoid paraphrasing. Try rewriting the article without referring to the ordering of information in the source itself, and try changing up the sentence structure too. That way, you'd be able to re-interpret and express the information with greater clarity. For example, the article currently contains redundant wording that repeat the same points: "''were not aware of their history''" "''completely unaware of their Sith history''."

*Chapter book is the proper industry terminology for ''Servants of the Empire''. Disney even calls the books that on listings. Just for reference, books are divided into:
**Young readers (~30 pages)
**Chapter books (~100-110 pages)
**Middle grade (~120-~250 pages) - we've been calling these "junior novels" - that's technically not the right terminology. I'm gonna try and go around and fix that. We'll see. TBD.
**Young adult (~300)
**Adult (~300+) [[User:Dentface|Dentface]] ([[User talk:Dentface|talk]]) 20:31, 13 October 2022 (UTC)

*So, the OOU recipie uses figs, hmm? So at my store, Produce does currently have figs in stock. They come in a plastic box with a barcode and everything, so you'd think they would scan and you wouldn't have to input a PLU. You'd ''think''. But for whatever reason the barcode isn't in the system so I have to manually input the price-6.29-each time someone buys them, which wouldn't be an issue if I could remember the price lol. But I can't so I'm always running over to produce to check.

*I checked all the possible relevant stuff listed as sources or appearances for [[Soontir Fel/Legends]], [[181st Imperial Fighter Wing/Legends]], and [[Saber Squadron (Imperial)/Legends]], and very few stuff is a confirmed representation of Saber 1. Notably, even when Fel was separately established to have fought at Endor, and Saber 1 was piloted by him around that time, no confirmation he flew Saber 1 and not another interceptor then. Finally, I intentionally only noted the Fel CCG card as gameplay statistic for Saber 1, because he could have been operating a [[TIE/LN starfighter]], which interceptors evidently have similar interior surfaces to, or could have been in a simulation, or any other scenario that doesn't involve him in Saber 1 in that image.

*<s>Since this article is about a location, I'd like to see it being noted where did the handoff of the tapestry take place and where was the line about Sag Kemper delivered. Were the two events roughly coincident in time and setting?</s> [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 08:38, 25 March 2022 (UTC)
**All that is known about the handoff of the tapestry is that it was a gift from the Republic for the Jedi's assistance during the Great Disaster. (Thereforce it must have taken place in either 230 BBY or 231 BBY, which I will note). The line about Sag Kemper was in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, which I will update.[[User:ThrawnChiss7|ThrawnChiss7]] ([[User talk:ThrawnChiss7|talk]]) 20:46, 25 March 2022 (UTC)
***Is there really evidence in the novel supporting the statement that the two events occurred within the same year? If there isn't, you probably should simply say that the second event happened "subsequently". Also, I noticed you removed the mention of Cantaros - was that intentional? If it was, the comma between the mentions of Vitus and Rwoh should probably become "and" instead. [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 20:04, 27 March 2022 (UTC)
****Sorry, they are not in the same year. I also changed that since the handing off didn't take place in the novel, it is just mentioned it must be in either 232 BBY or 231 BBY.[[User:ThrawnChiss7|ThrawnChiss7]] ([[User talk:ThrawnChiss7|talk]]) 03:43, 29 March 2022 (UTC)
****The change was intentional, as  in Out of the Shadows Imri walks away and Vitus and Rowh enter the temple without him.[[User:ThrawnChiss7|ThrawnChiss7]] ([[User talk:ThrawnChiss7|talk]]) 03:43, 29 March 2022 (UTC)

**Responding to 2nd and 3rd together. For the third, it seems we've always alphabetically ordered cards.

***Many card games list the cards in expansion alphabetically, or alphabetically to a degree ([[Star Wars Trading Card Game|SWTCG]] generally lists cards by rarity THEN alphabetically with some exceptions).

*I checked all sources mentioning (not just picturing, etc) [[Sheckil/Legends]] after the CCG card, and his twin who's not Boba Fett was only in the card and ''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''.

**None given. There is an implication that certain of Ferr's personnel assignments are intended to cause disorder within certain areas of the Nihil, possibly to prevent anyone from being able to challenge Ro, but it's only an implication.

*<s>If you edit the page, you'll see a hidden [[:Category:Marvel usages with the same archivedate value]]. This is because [[Template:Marvel]] has an [[Template:Marvel/Archive|archive page]], which essentially lists urls and the associated archivedate on one page. This means your addition of archivedate on the template is a duplicate, hence the category. You just need to remove the archivedate, but pointing it out so you can keep an eye out on future articles (and prevents someone having to update it later).

*<s>Per what I can gather (barring if it's mentioned elsewhere), it comes from the mention of "For a palate cleanser, Ithorian starfruit blended in a light creme liqueur." - I believe? In which case, it's referred to in the text as "light creme liqueur", which would be a better title for the article, and would not need the conjecture tag. Starfruit could be blended into the liqueur as an ingredient, but is not cause to conjecturalize it into its naming.</s>'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 06:24, 5 April 2022 (UTC)

***If starfruit is only an additive ingredient though, would 'creme liqueur' or similar title with noting the fruit as a blend-in of that beverage be accurate? It seems like the liqueur exists regardless of starfruit being blended into it or not, which would make it a dish of it's own right that would make the usage of starfruit in the title improper given there is a prose name for the beverage on its own.'''—[[User:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">spookywilloww</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Spookywilloww|<span style="color:#aa76de; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">talk</span>]]</sup>''' 19:44, 10 April 2022 (UTC)

**As per a discussion on Discord, it is of my opinion that Behling should not be in the Editor category unless he worked as an editor on a ''Star Wars'' project. That does not seem to be the case.

*****Sorry about this Cade.

Here is the mention in ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil]]'' ''He (Qilori) was sitting alone in a corner of the compound's dining area, watching the red clouds surrounding the sun as it sank toward the horizon and tried to put some of the day's more stomach turning images out of his mind, when he had a pair of visitors.'' It doesn't say that the sun made the clouds red, so we can't assume anything.

***After discussing with other editors, the practice is generally employed whenever the date note's length exceeds pipelinking it. It's not very intuitive when the reader opens the reference and is only greeted by a big block of text. It would be appreciated if you could retroactively do this for your previous noms as well.

=====Manoof=====
*<s>I think the removing of the badge by "the brass" should be removed from this article, as it's not clear if "the brass" is this officer, being his direct superior; a more senior officer or a committee/panel/group of senior officers who made the decision as a group. You could still close the article by saying that he had his badge removed, just disconnect that action as a direct action by this officer, if that makes sense. [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 12:33, 16 March 2022 (UTC)</s>
**Per Helmet Collection 65, the superior officer did indeed "fire" Posla. I have replaced the wording "brass" to high ranking for some more formality.

***Still one use of brass that needs to be changed. I think the only acceptable use would be to say that Posla mentioned his badge was taken by "the brass" or something like that, so it's clear those are his words, but that would be in addition to explaining the event itself i.e. Posla lost his badge and then later explained "the brass" took his badge [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 13:08, 18 March 2022 (UTC)

**Helmet collection says "fired," which is the same thing, but I'd rather attribute the relevant source to the specific "taking his badge" part.

***If I may interject, the film is not a source listed on this article, so I believe it's not worth mentioning it at all.

*<s>A disambig page for [[Taurin]] should be created.</s>
*(Review note) I don't know why, but I've seen a lot of your creator noms use little to no pronouns, only referring to people by last name for the whole article, which makes for a bit of a clunky read. Don't be afraid to mix in some variation. [[User:JediMasterMacaroni|<font style="font-family:copperplate; color:#ff4d00;">'''JediMasterMacaroni'''</font>]][[User talk:JediMasterMacaroni|<sup><font style="color:#ff4d00;">(Talk)</font></sup>]] 18:04, 6 March 2022 (UTC)
**Disambig: Done. [[User:Dentface|Dentface]] ([[User talk:Dentface|talk]]) 00:24, 7 March 2022 (UTC)
**For articles like [[Liz Marsham]] and others, I agree. Your feedback has been noted and I'll be a little more careful going forward. For this article in particular, I'm not sure how much else I could change it regarding pronouns. The second paragraph feels like it needs it at the start since it's a new paragraph. And then the second use is to distinguish him from the scene describing Keeve Trennis. If you still feel pronouns need to be sprinkled in a little more in this article in particular, please let me know. [[User:Dentface|Dentface]] ([[User talk:Dentface|talk]]) 00:24, 7 March 2022 (UTC)
***It should be find now. I added a couple myself, hence why it's marked as a review note and not an objection.

====Comments====
*Normally, variant covers are included in TPBs in galleries either at the end of a specific issue or at the very end of the TPB itself. Neither is the case for Clarke's variant, which is why the TPB collecting THR #2 is omitted from the sources section.

**Sorted.
*Did the Creed fall after the Battle of the Tower? If not, why was Namir fighting in the battle between the GE and the RA?
**Not sure what you mean here. The fall of the Creed and its cloister is placed chronologically before the article gets into the battle, and then the ruins are mentioned in the sentence stemming from the battle. As for Namir's fight with the GE, that's arguably not much relevant to Templemarch as that stuff happened at the transmitter tower.
***Makes sense, but I think that it should be at least specified that he was fighting for the GE.

====Comments====
*Notes:
**I've opted not to mention the GCW in relation to the Battle of Yavin, against [[Dusk in Kachirho|precedence]], since I believe all the article has to do here in mentioning the battle is to establish a timeframe.
**I used a double ref to cover the entirety of the second paragraph since going back and forth between SWG and TPM would be very unfeasible for an article like this.
**I was very selective with the descriptions for the various characters. For example, I figured "portraits"/"figure" would suffice for Gui-Gon and Padm, since there's not much to be said about their expressions (at least objectively) and the directions of their gaze isn't relevant to the composition. I did, however, point out the specific clothing Padm was wearing, since her outfit changes virtually every time she appears (hence dedicated [[Padm Amidala's wardrobe|wardrobe]] articles). Of course, there's a lot more action going on with Obi-Wan, and I had to mention that smile of Jar Jar's. [[User:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111">'''OOM'''</span>]] [[User talk:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111;font-family:franklin gothic">224</span>]] 17:38, 20 March 2022 (UTC)
**Also, all the juicy BTS details for the OOU theatrical poster isn't relevant to this particular IU subject, so I've left most of them out. They belong on the [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] and [[Drew Struzan]] articles instead.

*<s>Isn't "Thearterra center" a non-conjectural name?</s>
**nah, in the context its more of an easier way to refer to it then actually being its name
***Hmm, it's pretty common practice to take non-formal names as non-conjectural though. [[T'zaki language]] is an example of this - an easy way that the text non-formally refers to a subject that we use without the Conjecture template.

*Is ''[[A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker]]'' also an adaptation, or is it similar to the [[Death Star (novel)|''Death Star'' novel]] or ''[[The Rise and Fall of Darth Vader]]'' in being independent novels that also include the events of ANH? If so, then perhaps by default the details there should be taken as the canon version of events? I know that as is, you've already considered it such, but still asking.

**Crew skill missions are weird in that regardless of wether or not they're clearly affiliated with one side, both sides can play them so it can't be assumed.

*<s>Does the game actually establish that the player-characters are mercenaries, specifically?</s> [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 11:31, 27 January 2022 (UTC)
**The game's box uses the terms "''take on the roles of bounty hunters, smugglers, and mercenaries''" and the game rules notes that the game is "''about scoundrels and mercenaries''". '''However''', it specifically notes "''the goal of '''Outer Rim''' is to become the most famous (or infamous) mercenary in the galaxy.''" as well as noting that "''Fame represents... how much other mercenaries fear and idolize you.''" The only way to win the game is accumulating more fame than other players, so feel like mercenary is the best term to use for the PCs of the game. I also feel that bounty hunters and smugglers are specific TYPES of mercenary, and a scoundrel is not a mutually exclusive term that is more appropriate to use in describing HOW business is conducted, rather than WHAT business is conducted.

**It's mentioned in the mission ("A popular Nautolan musician would like very much to own a pair of ginxes, which are banned as pets on Glee Anselm.

*<s>What is the "first wave"?</s>
**Added.
***Is that referring to the first attacks on the Chespea temple or some wider campaign involving the Nihil? If the latter, is it the [[Nihil conflict]]?
****No, this is the only attack on Chespea. From my understanding the Nihil conflict article covers the issues with the Nihil that the Republic has been dealing with throughout all of SW:THR (232&ndash;230 BBY). The first wave is what we see in the OOU First and Second Wave of THR material.

*<s>I get that you're possibly going for some variety there, but in this case I do think that beginning the article with the likes of "A male individual served as the leader of a Nihil Cloud" would read more friendly to the casual reader who's not necessarily familiar with THR material and would also give you the opportunity to fluidly add some much-needed context for both the Nihil and Clouds.</s>
**Switched.
*<s>"''However, the Cloud leader snappishly clarified that they had transitioned to attacking Jedi directly in order to send a message.''" &mdash; not sure that "directly" is the word you're really looking for here. Even just attacking a Jedi temple in the first place is ''attacking the Jedi directly''. Per the quote, something like "exclusively attacking Jedi" would sound like a better fit to me.</s>
**Fair enough, done.
*<s>"''That goal was ultimately successful as the attack resulted in the destruction of the Jedi temple and the deaths of every Jedi on Chespea.''" &mdash; per the previous sentence, it reads to me as if the ''goal'' of the Nihil there was to ''send a message'' to the Jedi instead of merely ''attacking them'' for the sheer purpose of attacking. So unless we get some info about the Jedi ''reaction'' to the attack we can't really judge whether the goal was successful or not based on merely the fact that the attack took place.</s> [[User:Imperators II|<b><span>Imperators II</span></b>]]<sup>[[User talk:Imperators II|(Talk)]]</sup> 07:39, 23 May 2022 (UTC)

=====Vergence=====
*<s>You describe insider 211 as the 211th issue of the magazine, but the actual article for [[Insider 211]] calls it the 189th issue due to shenanigans with the Lucasfilm fan club magazine. (The same numbering is used for the other issues, so 210th is 188th, 211th is 190th, etc.) Would it reasonable to use 189th here as well, or are the insider articles wrong to use that numbering?</s> [[User:VergenceScatter|VergenceScatter]] ([[User talk:VergenceScatter|talk]]) 20:58, 2 August 2022 (UTC)
**The individual issues use that to differentiate from the Lucasfilm Fan Club magazine, but I think that goes beyond the scope of articles discussing Insider.

**If the information regarding Vaathkree was the same in both the sampler and the actual comic issue, sure.

****Again, I do not believe this is context that is relevant enough for ''this subject'' to warrant its inclusion here.

***You can't make this claim on an illustration. They aren't going to design a ship and put a turbolaser on once side and not the other, it just not logical.

*<s>'''"At one point during the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a Venator I of the Open Circle Fleet was present near Valor, a space station orbiting the planet Carida of the Colonies' Carida system."''' A couple things on this sentence. First, I believe proper grammar would be to italicize Venator I, as it is still the proper name of the ship class. Second, this reads somewhat awkward to me. I'm not sure if it should be broken into two sentences, or perhaps just something like"...planet Carida, located in the Carida system which was part of the Colonies region of the galaxy."</s> - [[User:JMAS|<b><span style="color: #C00">JMAS</span></b>]] <sup>[[File:Jolly Trooper.png|20px]] [[User talk:JMAS|Hey, it's me!]]</sup> 05:08, 16 March 2022 (UTC)

**Is Atomic Mass Games mentioned on the card? [[User:Loqiical|Loqiical]] ([[User talk:Loqiical|talk]]) 05:55, 16 March 2022 (UTC)
***No. Because all the promotional, pre-release preview images of the card were made while ''Armada'' was still under the FFG banner. And it was probably sent to the printer already as well. I highly doubt they would have reprinted the cards, particularly since FFG and Atomic Mass Games are all under the [[Asmodee]] parent company. But by the time the product officially was released, it was by Atomic Mass Games. - [[User:JMAS|<b><span style="color: #C00">JMAS</span></b>]] <sup>[[File:Jolly Trooper.png|20px]] [[User talk:JMAS|Hey, it's me!]]</sup> 06:25, 16 March 2022 (UTC)

*<s>Per JMAS, I also agree that there's a dual turbolaser there.

**Pardon my interjection, but the symmetrical thing was discussed on the Discord. Per an EC member as well as [[Venator II-class Star Destroyer|''Venator II''-class Star Destroyer]] and ''[[Patriot Fist]]'', if only one side is seen to have something, we shouldn't assume it's symmetrical.

***One problem with this. The zoomed-in and section-enhanced image I posted above shows that it '''''is''''' symentrical and located on both sides.

******I can't find any official release date on AMG, Asmodee or FFG's sites. However, Amazon lists the publication date as July 16, 2021. Now, Amazon also lists FFG as the publisher, but since Asmodee's own website lists AMG as the publisher, that trumps a third party seller. But if the third party (Amazon) is the only place that lists a publication date, then I think that's the date that should be listed, right? - [[User:JMAS|<b><span style="color: #C00">JMAS</span></b>]] <sup>[[File:Jolly Trooper.png|20px]] [[User talk:JMAS|Hey, it's me!]]</sup> 12:41, 24 March 2022 (UTC)

*Context for Utaruun.
*"''During the century leading up to[1] 43 ABY,[3] however, the Cranan-Excarga Route brought lots of trade and smuggler traffic from the planets after Cirus and Melnea's World.''" And the trade is being brought to Vor Deo, right? That should be clarified.
*Watch out for duplicate links, specifically the Cranan-Excarga Route.

*Please describe the outfits that incorporated wedding fabrics (ex. what made [[Yan]] and [[Sach]]'s outfits mirrors of each other?)

*<s>Context for when and why Padm asked for Yan's advice (before her wedding to Anakin Skywalker, because Yan was previously her wardrobe mistress, that sort of thing) [[User:Immi Thrax|<font style="color:#fc008f; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Immi Thrax</font>]] [[File:RainbowRebellion2.png|20px|link=Wookieepedia:WookieeProject_Pride]] (she/her) [[User_talk:Immi_Thrax|(talk)]] 04:29, 10 August 2022 (UTC)</s>
*<s>The additional details will push the word count up into "needs intro and sectioning" territory; at that point, keep an eye out in case it gets past CA length.

*<s>Appearances and sources for [[Padm Amidala's wedding dress]] need to be listed. That article's lists are incomplete, so there's going to be more research ahead.

**The only part of Padm's outfit relevant to this page is the veil, and only the fact that it's made of the wedding fabric is really relevant to this page. The only other piece of description included about Yan and Sach's wedding outfits is that Sach's outfit had wide-legged pants, which is not relevant specifically to wedding fabric as it is ''not'' the part of the outfit where the fabric was incorporated.
***The reason I disagree with not describing them is that, as currently written, it's unclear if Yan and Sach are wearing identical outfits ("mirrored"), or both of them wore trains and sashes, or something else. [[User:Immi Thrax|<font style="color:#fc008f; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Immi Thrax</font>]] [[File:RainbowRebellion2.png|20px|link=Wookieepedia:WookieeProject_Pride]] (she/her) [[User_talk:Immi_Thrax|(talk)]] 03:54, 12 August 2022 (UTC)
****I don't think it's strictly relevant to the article, but it's in there for now. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 04:25, 12 August 2022 (UTC)
*****That's better, getting there! I know this involves a bit of mindreading, so would it be all right if I adjusted the part about Yan and Sach or suggested wording here? As for Padm's, the book sounds to me like her entire piece of fabric became the veil. That veil is partially described in the book with additional details coming from other sources. The pleating is something Padm explicitly adds, but other details of flower embroidery and wax drop stamens aren't clearly distinguished as originating with the fabric or additions she made--thus I think those veil details should be included. I'm not sure about whether there should be BTS details about Trisha Biggar and the veil or if those are better suited to the wedding dress article, what do you think?

******Okay, that does make sense. I'm not going to be able to follow up on this until August 26/27, though, because I'm travelling and nowhere close to my copy of the book right now. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 20:15, 18 August 2022 (UTC)
*******I'm good with discussing further then! :) [[User:Immi Thrax|<font style="color:#fc008f; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Immi Thrax</font>]] [[File:RainbowRebellion2.png|20px|link=Wookieepedia:WookieeProject_Pride]] (she/her) [[User_talk:Immi_Thrax|(talk)]] 09:47, 19 August 2022 (UTC)
**Added.
***A little more context, please. The article never says to whom Padm is getting married.

**Hasn't happened so far. 163 words.
**I don't think appearances of the wedding dress itself count for appearances of wedding fabric; it isn't like we count every appearance of a lightsaber as the appearance of a kyber crystal. The material has been transformed from its base state. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 04:40, 10 August 2022 (UTC)
***I follow your reasoning, but unfortunately, other status articles about materials ''do'' count what a material is part of as an appearance/source. For instance, [[chokeroot]] and [[mashed chokeroot]] have [[Fried Endorian Tip-Yip]] listings. If that's something you think should be changed, maybe start a SH to have a wider discussion? [[User:Immi Thrax|<font style="color:#fc008f; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Immi Thrax</font>]] [[File:RainbowRebellion2.png|20px|link=Wookieepedia:WookieeProject_Pride]] (she/her) [[User_talk:Immi_Thrax|(talk)]] 03:54, 12 August 2022 (UTC)
****I'll do that. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 04:25, 12 August 2022 (UTC)
****[[Forum:SH:When should ingredients be counted as appearing?|Here's]] that SH thread. And just to paraphrase what I said there, I don't think any appearances of Padme's wedding dress count as an appearance of wedding fabric because it's been modified enough to be part of the outfit that it can no longer be easily identified which part of the outfit has the fabric if you don't already know. My interpretation of what the book meant about this is that wedding fabric is the raw pieces of fabric, as yet unincorporated into clothing, not the outfits actually containing the fabric. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 04:36, 12 August 2022 (UTC)
*****Striking that objection for this time since that's a wider discussion in progress, don't want it to hold up this nom. [[User:Immi Thrax|<font style="color:#fc008f; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Immi Thrax</font>]] [[File:RainbowRebellion2.png|20px|link=Wookieepedia:WookieeProject_Pride]] (she/her) [[User_talk:Immi_Thrax|(talk)]] 10:12, 15 August 2022 (UTC)
=====Manoof=====
*"'' Her sister, Sola Naberrie, chose not to marry and used her share as clothing for her daughters, symbolizing they belonged to the family.''"  Can this be clarified since it's already established that the fabric is passed down. Were her daughters adopted or something? [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 10:00, 27 August 2022 (UTC)
*Did Padme follow Yane's advice or no? it's not clear if the decision was made BECAUSE or IRRESPECTIVE of the advice. [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 10:00, 27 August 2022 (UTC)
*The Culture of Naboo category can be removed, as Padme's wardrobe is a subcategory of it. [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 10:00, 27 August 2022 (UTC)
*Historic info in the intro should align to the Body, so you need to move the mention of the fabric's use in Padme's dress to after the mention of the use for Sache/Yane [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 10:00, 27 August 2022 (UTC)
*"''Members of such families would inherit pieces of the fabric''" is reiterating the previous sentence [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 10:00, 27 August 2022 (UTC)
*"''it was in style for wedding fabric to be used in sashes and trains.''" Can this be cut and the following sentence mention "according to the style of the time", as it is repetitive for the repeated mention of sashes and trains. [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 10:00, 27 August 2022 (UTC)
*The sentence for Amidala's family needs a tweak, as "her" could potentially be interpreted to mean Padme rather than Sola. [[User:Manoof|Manoof]] <small>(he/him/his)</small> ([[User_talk:Manoof|talk]]) 10:00, 27 August 2022 (UTC)
**I've handled most of that. Check back on the upcoming GAN page when it shows up.
**I have removed it from the Padme's wardrobe category page, as I feel that category already contains too many articles about clothing and accessories not unique to her wardrobe (e.g. [[Shiraya fan headdress]]). I think it needs a massive cleanup. [[User:SilverSunbird|SilverSunbird]] ([[User talk:SilverSunbird|talk]]) 01:54, 28 August 2022 (UTC)

====Comments====
*There's some odd and vague wording in the article, which is the result of my efforts to translate the vague phrasing of the mission into the encyclopedic summary expected of a Wookieepedia article. "...with the intention of seeking black market opportunities..." is my best attempt at interpreting "Although it's invitation only, there will be plenty of other opportunities for the savvy black marketeer; send your companion.". Similarly, the mission is vague about *how* exactly the Zeltron losing after putting up crap as collateral is beneficial to the companion. I assume the implication is that a loan shark sold the possessions at auction to the companion, but that ain't explicit the mission just says "Your Companion hit it big when an overconfident Zeltron gambler put up some rare possessions as collateral on a loan and promptly lost." I wavered on even mentioning the Zeltron at all, but given that their loss occurs at Flynn's tournament I opted to include it.

*<s>I want to confirm that ''Annihilation'' can support that date since the novels usually don't provide such dates.</s> [[User:Shayanomer|<span style="color:#DEB40D">'''Shayanomer'''</span>]] [[File:Din Djarin's clan.svg|15px]] ([[User talk:Shayanomer|<span style="color:#A06800">'''talk'''</span>]]) 17:15, 14 January 2022 (UTC)
**TERC puts Annihilation in 3640 BBY, specifically the end of that year per discussion with the writers, and the novel places the collapse of the treaty 18 months prior.

****On second thoughts arboreal is a pretty direct reference to trees so I've changed it. And just because someone's been around longer doesn't mean you shouldn't question them on stuff that seems off. Everyone makes mistakes, and at worse they'll just explain the reasoning for it.
