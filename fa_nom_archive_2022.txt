*The history need not document every dialogue of back-and-forth between the characters. In terms of focusing the content on the ranch itself, the material there can be condensed a lot, for relevancy.
*The novel's main page seems to have some solid date notes, some sort of year range at least can be established for the events that took place the ranch. Additionally, the information on the page should be presented in the order that it occurs IU, not the order the novel presents it to the reader, meaning the ranch should be established to have been taken under the ownership of the married pair prior to mentioning the visit to the establishment.

*Don't forget to add [[:Category:Images of Aurebesh]] when an image present text in Aurebesh (fixed). Also... I just realised that <nowiki><pre></pre></nowiki> does not format text like it did before, wish was very useful on Aurebesh transliteration in image's description. Most likely a result of one of the recent software update, I already left a note about this on the fandom channel on Discord.

=====Governor Fanland=====
*<s>"For three years, she and her forces faced great trouble in dealing with grallocs, a cousin species to mynock creatures, in the sector, and gleaned information about them." The final part of this sentence, about gleaning information, feels awkward. The word choice of "gleaning" in particular feels odd-in my expeireince gleaning tends to be more used for research rather than knowledge gained through experience.</s>
**Reworded. [[User:Shayanomer|<span style="color:#DEB40D">'''Shayanomer'''</span>]] [[File:Din Djarin's clan.svg|15px]] ([[User talk:Shayanomer|<span style="color:#A06800">'''talk'''</span>]]) 12:39, 23 January 2022 (UTC)
*<s>"She later tasked the Imperial forces at the Kurost transfer point with a dozen insurgency-suppression missions across the Esaga sector, leaving the transfer point defenseless against Grysk Hegemony forces." What's the point of mentioning the Grysk here? This is their only mention in the whole article.

***A little better, but still a bit confusing. Maybe try and split it to two different sentences?

*<s>Referencing should be removed from the intro.</s>
*Needs an equipment section and could probably use as "skills and abilities" section
*I know there aren't any images of Ziinda herself, but there are images of related subjects, like the CDF logo, that could be added.

=====Macaroni=====
*Please check for duplicate links.
*You seem to be using a semicolon as a comma here: "The citadel was badly damaged due to Ludo Kressh's bombardment of the planet in the Battle of Khar Delba; but Sadow rebuilt it and, from there, put together a fleet that went on to attack the Republic in the Great Hyperspace War." You'll want to remove the "but" from the second half of the sentence (after the semicolon, since "but" can't start a grammatically correct sentence and semicolons should be in the middle of two independent clauses) or you can replace the semicolon with a comma.
*The bts only needs to discuss the first issue it appeared in, not the other issues or subsequent arc.

No Dresselians are seen boarding the shuttle, though there are a couple of hooded figures that may have been Panno." Only one I think is likely is the hooded figure immediately after Han, there's a figure visible under Han's arm once inside but I can't make out what it is.

**I already saw that blog post way before I was even close to nominating Panno, possibly even before I worked on [[Chiraneau/Legends|Chiraneau]], for reference of how long I remember seeing that post. That scene has the other Dressellian from the briefing, who's also seen in the celebration with Panno.

*<s>Gosh, the Ewok films have terrible lighting:</s>
**Given the less-eventful nature of the "Mother of four Ewoks" section, I can see why its contents were left out of the intro, but perhaps you could sum it up by saying that she raised her children, caring for them and helping to teach them to be brave/considerate.
***Er, what's your source on that?
**"falling comet" &mdash; should clarify that Wicket thought it was a comet, given that it's not actually one. Also, I assume it was your intention not to link "vessel" in the next paragraph since it's not really a starship?
***Done, and I don't remember if that was intentional but it is correct.
**"who ran inside" &mdash; inside where?
***Added.
**For the next subsection, I think it'd be clearer if you remove "albeit incorrectly" and explain in another sentence that the other Ewoks realised Wicket was actually alive later on.
***Done.
**"Shodu was standing outside" &mdash; sorry to do this again, but outside where?
***Done.
**It would help to explicitly establish that the Humans did not understand the Ewoks' language. Otherwise, their interactions might seem strange to some readers.
***Done.
**Inconsistency between "Cindel and Mace"/"Mace and Cindel"
***Fixed.
**I've noticed that Shodu calls Wicket "honey drop" at least twice, so that's something that could be added to P&T.
***Added.
**For the Equipment section, Shodu wore a purple dress when she woke Wicket up from his nightmare.
***Pretty sure those are pajamas but done :P
**As for the final paragraph about brown fur/gray fur, it seems to me that there's no need for it to be mentioned there at all. It's just that her fur changed colour IU as time went by (probably due to aging etc.) [[User:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111">'''OOM'''</span>]] [[User talk:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111;font-family:franklin gothic">224</span>]] 09:02, 26 April 2022 (UTC)

******Talking to some friends who play SWTOR, that's a non-player mission where you send your "crew" off to collect minor rewards. I think all we can say is that during the Third Galactic War, factions attempted to recruit aid from the Zeison Sha on Yanibar, but it's . . . completely optional.

**A Zeison Sha warrior speaks to Jedi emissaries in the lead quote, but the event doesn't seem to be mentioned in the article body.

**Repetition of "''independence and survival(,) as well as assistance to those in need''" between the intro and History section. In fact, you could probably do without it in the History section and instead add in something about their abandonment, which seems to be information that is exclusive to the intro.
***Tweaked. [[User:Atarumaster88|<span style="color:seagreen;">'''Atarumaster88'''</span>]] <sup>([[User talk:Atarumaster88|<span style="color:seagreen;">Talk page</span>]])</sup> 14:47, 7 May 2022 (UTC)
**"''A major development of Zeison Sha history''" &mdash; unless the source says something to this effect, I feel like this is editorialising.
***Ooookay, so this one's kinda messy. The problem is the divergent backstories for the Zeison Sha. KotOR/TOR imply the Zeison Sha are not only founded millennia earlier, but exist on ''Yanibar.'' That doesn't work at all with the other recorded histories (even IU as noted in EGTTF) that all have the New Sith Wars as '''the''' seminal trigger for the founding of the Zeison Sha. I'm happy to wordsmith this however you would like but while I could explain EGTTF away as incomplete information based on the IU narrator, JATM and Hero's Guide are OOU as far as I know. Thoughts on how to write around the continuity problem? If we assume both sources are correct and the Zeison Sha were established prior to the NSW on Yanibar, I would describe the arrival of thousands of colonists, many of whom were Force-sensitive and subsequently joined/absorbed the Order, as "major."

****Ooh, I see. In that case, I'd say the current wording works pretty well in integrating the info from all those sources. [[User:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111">'''OOM'''</span>]] [[User talk:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111;font-family:franklin gothic">224</span>]] 16:17, 7 May 2022 (UTC)
**Also, it's strange that that paragraph and the one right after doesn't mention the Zeison Sha by name at all, bar the instance I pointed out here. See if you can slip in a few. [[User:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111">'''OOM'''</span>]] [[User talk:OOM 224|<span style="color:#d1a111;font-family:franklin gothic">224</span>]] 22:50, 3 May 2022 (UTC)

*<s>"''The Zeison Sha were an order of Force-adepts '''known for''' their survival skills and resourcefulness...''"

**EGTTF explicitly states that the "original colonists might have perished had not some of them been Force-sensitive" and "their descendants developed a new Force tradition, the Zeison Sha, whose members used their talents to deal with the dangers native to Yanibar and defend the otherwise defenseless." I've reworded "resourcefulness" to "self-reliance" as that's better-supported by the text, but I don't think "survival skills" is original research based on the quoted passage.
